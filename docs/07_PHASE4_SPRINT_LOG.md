# Part 1 — Architecture & Features

## 1. Network Architecture

**Files:** `hexo_rl/model/network.py`, `hexo_rl/training/trainer.py`,
`configs/model.yaml`, `configs/training.yaml`

> Forward pointers — current authority:
>
> - Input grew 18 → 24 at §92 and reverted 24 → 18 at §97; dropped 18 → 8 at §131.
>   Current: **8 planes** (KEPT_PLANE_INDICES = [0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11] from the
>   18-plane index space). Chain is an aux target in a separate replay-buffer
>   sub-buffer.
> - BatchNorm replaced with **GroupNorm(8)** throughout at §99. Pre-§99 checkpoints refuse to load.
> - Selective policy loss (§100) gates policy / opp_reply losses on `is_full_search`; value / chain / ownership / threat losses apply to all rows.

```
Input:  (18, 19, 19) tensor
        Planes 0-15: 8 history steps × 2 players (cluster snapshots)
        Planes 16-17: metadata (moves_remaining, turn parity)

Trunk:  12 × ResidualBlock(128ch, SE reduction=4)
        Post-activation: Conv → GN(8) → ReLU → Conv → GN(8) → SE → + skip → ReLU
        SE blocks: squeeze C→C/4→C per block (~1% FLOPs, validated in KataGo/LCZero)

Heads:
  Policy:      Conv(128→2, 1×1) → ReLU → Flatten → Linear → log_softmax
               (no GN — 2 channels; selective loss gates via full_search_mask, §100)
  Value:       GlobalAvgPool + GlobalMaxPool → concat(256) → Linear(256) → Linear(1) → tanh
               Loss: BCE(sigmoid(v_logit), (z+1)/2)   ← logit path avoids atanh NaN
  Opp reply:   Mirror of policy, training only, weight=0.15 (gated by full_search_mask per §100)
  Ownership:   Conv(1×1) → tanh → (19×19), weight=0.1, spatial MSE (target from replay-buffer u8 column, §85)
  Threat:      Conv(1×1) → raw logit → (19×19), weight=0.1, BCEWithLogitsLoss
               with pos_weight = threat_pos_weight (default 59.0, Q19; §92)
  Chain:       Conv(1×1) → (6, 19, 19), smooth-L1, weight aux_chain_weight (default 1.0);
               target read from ReplayBuffer chain_planes sub-buffer post-§97 (not input slice)
  Uncertainty: trunk → AdaptiveAvgPool → Linear → Softplus → σ² (DISABLED — see below)

Output: (log_policy, value, value_logit)  ← always 3-tuple for all inference callers
```

- `forward()` always returns the 3-tuple. BCE loss needs the raw logit; atanh(tanh(x)) was numerically unstable (NaN).
- Value loss: BCE not MSE — sharper gradients for binary outcomes.
- Global pooling value head is board-size-independent.
- Ownership head rationale: teaches the network where stones end up, giving the value head spatial grounding far from game end.
- Threat head rationale: teaches which cells form winning patterns, directly supporting quiescence reasoning.

**Policy target pruning:** Zero out entries < 2% of max visits, renormalise before CE/KL loss. Config: `policy_prune_frac: 0.02`. Applied once in Python training — Rust `get_improved_policy()` no longer prunes (double-pruning removed at §62 because first prune + renorm makes second prune non-idempotent, producing targets much sharper than intended).

**Entropy regularisation:** `L_total = L_policy + L_value + w_aux·L_aux − w_entropy·H(π)`. Weight `entropy_reg_weight: 0.01`. Expected range ~3–6 nats; < 1.0 signals collapse.

**Uncertainty head (DISABLED):** Built at §33 (`forward(uncertainty=True)` returns σ², gradient stopped before reaching value head). Head exists in `network.py` but `uncertainty_weight: 0.0` in `configs/training.yaml` gates it entirely — `use_uncertainty=False` means the head never runs in the current training path. Disabled at §59 because Gaussian NLL diverges when σ² → 1e-6 clamp floor, causing `total_loss` spikes to ~394. `uncertainty_weight: 0.0` must be explicit in config — absence causes the trainer default to silently match but is fragile on resume. Re-enable only after adding σ² regularisation (log-barrier or β-VAE-style KL).

### torch.compile — DISABLED (§32) → RE-ENABLED (§116)

Arc: §3 added `reduce-overhead` → §25 re-enabled with split train/inf model instances → §30 changed to `mode="default"` (TLS crash on Python 3.14) → §32 fully disabled (27 GB Triton JIT spike blocks workers for 5+ min on first forward) → **§116 re-enabled `reduce-overhead` on PT2.11+Py3.14 (both blockers resolved)**.

**Current state:** `torch_compile: false` pending §116 AC-power bench gate.
**§116 probe verdict:** GO — all 3 modes work, 0 graph breaks, 1.50× throughput / 1.87× latency vs eager, VRAM spike 59.5 MB (was 27 GB). See `reports/investigations/torch_compile_retry_20260423/report.md`.

Note: `triton.cudagraphs=False` in PT2.11 — reduce-overhead gains come from kernel fusion, not CUDA graph replay.

## 2. MCTS

**Files:** `engine/src/mcts/`, `engine/src/board/`, `engine/src/game_runner/`,
`configs/selfplay.yaml`, `hexo_rl/selfplay/pool.py`

> Forward pointers — current authority:
>
> - `game_runner.rs` split into `game_runner/{mod,worker_loop,gumbel_search,records}.rs` at §86.
> - Dirichlet root noise ported to Rust on both PUCT and Gumbel branches at §73 (commit `71d7e6e`). Resolves Q17.
> - Gumbel flag moved from base config to named variants (`gumbel_full`, `gumbel_targets`, `baseline_puct`) at §67. Base `selfplay.yaml` has `gumbel_mcts: false, completed_q_values: false`.
> - ZOI is post-search only — §36 text corrected at §77; tree still expands with the full radius-8 legal set at all depths.
> - §36 temperature description reconciled to match Rust code at §70 C.1 resolution (quarter-cosine per compound_move, threshold=15, temp_min=0.05 floor). The legacy ply-based step schedule lives on only in `hexo_rl/selfplay/utils.py::get_temperature`, called from the Python `SelfPlayWorker` used by eval-adjacent paths (`our_model_bot`, `benchmark_mcts`), not on the training path.
> - `quiescence_fire_count` instrumentation added at §83.
> - `get_improved_policy` is PUCT-tree-safe (§74.1) — training can use Gumbel completed-Q policy targets on PUCT-built trees.

### Legal Move Margin — corrected to hex-ball radius 8 (§26)

Official rule: new hex ≤ 8 cells from any existing stone. Prior implementation used bbox+2 expansion (~5×5 rectangle per stone — far too small). Fixed to per-stone hex ball iteration: all (dq,dr) with `|dq|≤8, |dr|≤8, |dq+dr|≤8`. 217 cells/stone, deduplicated via FxHashSet. `LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS = 8`. This also matches `get_clusters()` which uses distance ≤ 8 for NN windowing — same threshold, independent purposes.

This correction ~9× expanded the branching factor and is the primary driver of MCTS sim/s reduction from ~190k → ~31k. Targets recalibrated accordingly.

### action_idx widened u16 → u32 (§38)

Pre-existing silent bug: u16 cap at 65,535 caused wrong child selection with global axial coordinate encoding after radius-8 legal move expansion. Fixed throughout `mcts/mod.rs` and `mcts/node.rs`.

### Dynamic FPU (§27)

```
explored_mass = Σ prior(a) for visited children
fpu_value     = parent_q − fpu_base × √explored_mass
```

Unvisited children use `fpu_value` instead of Q=0. As more children are visited, `fpu_value` becomes more pessimistic relative to `parent_q`, shifting exploration toward refining known-good branches. Config: `mcts.fpu_reduction: 0.25` (matches KrakenBot).

**Benchmark note:** fpu_reduction=0.25 causes MCTS sim/s regression in the CPU-only benchmark because all NN values=0 → FPU makes unvisited children look worse than visited → deeper/narrower tree. This is a benchmark artifact. In real self-play with non-zero NN values, FPU improves selection quality.

### Quiescence Value Override (§28 + §30 gate)

**Game-specific theorem:** Each turn places exactly 2 stones. Therefore the opponent can block at most 2 winning cells per response. If the current player has ≥3 empty cells where placing a stone completes a 6-in-a-row, the win is mathematically forced.

**Critical distinction from the removed forced-win short-circuit:**
The earlier `FormationDetector::has_forced_win()` short-circuit (removed post-baseline) fired at MCTS **expansion** and marked positions as terminal — the NN never evaluated them, preventing the network from learning forced-win patterns.

This quiescence check is a **VALUE OVERRIDE at leaf evaluation**:
- The NN still receives the position and produces (policy, value).
- The **POLICY is used unchanged** for MCTS expansion → network learns fork patterns.
- Only the **VALUE** is overridden with the proven result.

```
current_wins >= 3  → value = +1.0
opponent_wins >= 3 → value = -1.0
current_wins == 2  → value = min(value + blend_2, 1.0)
opponent_wins == 2 → value = max(value - blend_2, -1.0)
```

Config: `mcts.quiescence_enabled: true`, `mcts.quiescence_blend_2: 0.3`

**Two-tier performance gate (§30):** `count_winning_moves()` is O(legal_moves). Gate it:
1. Ply gate (free): skip if `board.ply < 8` (P1 needs ≥5 stones = ply 8 minimum).
2. Long-run pre-check: skip if neither player has `Board::has_player_long_run(5)`.
Net overhead: 1.8% vs no quiescence in the gated benchmark.

### ZOI (Zone of Interest) Lookback (§36)

Restricts MCTS candidates to cells within hex-distance 5 of the last 16 moves. Falls back to full legal set if < 3 candidates. Reduces the post-search move-selection pool without changing legal moves. Does NOT reduce the MCTS branching factor — the tree expands with the full radius-8 legal set at all depths. See §77.

Config: `mcts.zoi_enabled: true`, `mcts.zoi_radius: 5`, `mcts.zoi_history: 16`, `mcts.zoi_min_candidates: 3`

### Cosine-Annealed Temperature (§36; reconciled at §70 C.1)

Replaced the hard step at move 30 with a quarter-cosine schedule. Live
Rust implementation in `engine/src/game_runner/worker_loop.rs:20-31`
(`compute_move_temperature`), driven off **compound move** (not ply):

```
compound_move = (ply + 1) / 2  for ply > 0, else 0
τ(cm) = max(temp_min, cos(π/2 · cm / temp_threshold))   if cm <  temp_threshold
τ(cm) = temp_min                                        if cm >= temp_threshold
```

| compound_move | 0 | 5 | 10 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 20 | 30 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| τ | 1.0000 | 0.8660 | 0.5000 | 0.1045 | 0.0500 | 0.0500 | 0.0500 | 0.0500 |

Config: `selfplay.playout_cap.temperature_threshold_compound_moves: 15`,
`selfplay.playout_cap.temp_min: 0.05`. `mcts.temp_anneal_moves` /
`mcts.temp_min` are not read by the Rust training path — the live keys
are under `selfplay.playout_cap`. The legacy ply-based half-cosine
formulation described earlier in this section (and the `1.0 if ply<30
else 0.1` step schedule in `docs/01_architecture.md`) is obsolete on
the training path; the Python `get_temperature(ply, ...)` step schedule
in `hexo_rl/selfplay/utils.py` survives only for `SelfPlayWorker`, used
by eval-adjacent bots.

### Transposition Table — clear on new_game (§59)

`MCTSTree::new_game()` was resetting the node pool but not clearing the TT. Each `TTEntry` holds a heap-allocated `Vec<f32>` (362-element policy). With 12 workers × ~67 games each × ~100 moves × ~300 positions/move × ~1.5 KB/entry, the TT accumulated tens of GB over a sustained run (observed: 28 GB RSS after 500 min).

Fix: `self.transposition_table.clear()` added to `new_game()`. TT is per-game by nature — cross-game position reuse is negligible.

### Gumbel AlphaZero (§61 + §62) — OFF by default

Implements Danihelka et al. ICLR 2022. Two components:

**Completed Q-values policy targets:**
Standard AlphaZero trains policy toward visit-count distributions. At 50 sims (fast games, 25% of training), visit counts barely differ from prior. Instead:
1. Visited children (N>0): use Q(a) = W(a)/N(a)
2. Unvisited legal actions: use v_mix (interpolates root value with policy-weighted avg of visited Q)
3. `π_improved = softmax(log_prior + σ(completedQ))` where `σ = (c_visit + max_N) × c_scale × completedQ`
4. Training loss: KL(π_improved ∥ π_model) instead of CE with visit counts

Computed in Rust (`MCTSTree::get_improved_policy`) — all data is local, no extra PyO3 crossings. Config: `completed_q_values: true`, `c_visit: 50.0`, `c_scale: 1.0`.

**Sequential Halving root search:**
1. Gumbel-Top-k: generate Gumbel(0,1) noise, select top `m = min(n, 16, |legal|)` candidates. Replaces Dirichlet noise at root.
2. Sequential Halving: allocate budget across `ceil(log2(m))` phases, halving candidates each phase by `g(a) + log_prior(a) + sigma(Q_hat(a))`.
Non-root nodes: unchanged (PUCT + dynamic FPU).

**Hardening fixes (§62):** Budget off-by-one fixed (`sims_done = sims_used` in fallback). `max_n` cached per halving phase (was O(candidates²), now O(candidates)). Double-pruning removed (see policy target pruning note above). Config defaults restored: `gumbel_mcts: false`, `fast_prob: 0.25`.

Config: `gumbel_mcts: false` (opt-in), `gumbel_m: 16`, `gumbel_explore_moves: 10`

---

## 3. Replay Buffer

**Files:** `engine/src/replay_buffer/`, `hexo_rl/training/recency_buffer.py`,
`hexo_rl/selfplay/pool.py`, `configs/training.yaml`

> Forward pointers — current authority:
>
> - Initial tier raised back to 250K at §79.
> - Per-row aux target alignment (ownership + winning_line u8 columns) landed at §85.
> - File split mod/storage/push/sample/persist/sym_tables at §86. `engine/src/replay_buffer/sample.rs` now holds `sample_batch` + `apply_sym` kernels (the old `sampling.rs` was merged in).
> - `TensorBuffer` dead code deleted at §93 C9.5.
> - HEXB version history: v1 (§46b) → v2 → v3 (§92, added `n_planes` header; chain inside state at 24ch) → v4 (§97, 18 state + 6 chain separate sub-buffer) → **v5 (§100, adds `is_full_search` per-row column)**. v4 buffers still load with `is_full_search=1` default.
> - `chain_planes` augmentation scatter uses a dedicated `apply_chain_symmetry` pass with `axis_perm` remap (§92 C2, retained at §97).

### Growing Buffer + Mixed Streams (§2 + §40b + §79)

Buffer growth schedule (updated §79 — reverts §40b reduction):
```yaml
buffer_schedule:
  - {step: 0,           capacity: 250_000}
  - {step: 300_000,     capacity: 500_000}
  - {step: 1_000_000,   capacity: 1_000_000}
```
`ReplayBuffer.resize()` linearises ring buffer in-place via rotate_left, extends backing vecs.

Mixed pretrained + self-play: `pretrained_weight = max(0.1, 0.8 × exp(−step / 300_000))`. After §58 fix: pretrained stream is always initialised from the corpus NPZ when the file exists, regardless of `_buffer_restored`.

### Playout Cap Randomisation (§2 + §43)

- 25% of games: 50 sims, τ=1 throughout (value targets only — policy masked on zero-policy rows)
- 75% of games: 200 sims, τ=1 for first 15 compound moves then τ→0

Config: `playout_cap.fast_prob: 0.25`, `fast_sims: 50`, `standard_sims: 200`. fast_sims was tested at 30 and reverted — 50 produces meaningfully better policy signal for fast-game value targets.

### Recency-Weighted Replay (§33)

Lightweight Python-side `RecentBuffer` ring mirrors the newest ~50% of buffer capacity. Training batches: 75% recent / 25% full-buffer (augmented). Config: `recency_weight: 0.75`. Falls back to full-buffer when recent buffer is empty.

### Buffer Persistence (§46b)

Save/load added to `ReplayBuffer`: binary HEXB v1 format (magic `0x48455842`, little-endian). ~14.4 KB/entry; ~1.4 GB for 100K positions.

Two save points to prevent loss on unclean exit:
1. Inside `_run_loop()` on shutdown signal (before `break`, before `pool.stop()`).
2. Post-loop finally block (normal exit).

On resume: buffer is restored before `pool.start()`. Corpus prefill is skipped when `n_loaded >= 10_000` (threshold from §58 fix — `n_loaded > 0` was too permissive).

Config: `mixing.buffer_persist: true`, `mixing.buffer_persist_path: "checkpoints/replay_buffer.bin"`

### collect_data PyArray fix (§51)

Changed `collect_data()` return from `Vec<(Vec<f32>, Vec<f32>, f32, usize)>` to `(PyArray2<f32>, PyArray2<f32>, PyArray1<f32>, PyArray1<u64>)`. Previously each `Vec<f32>` was converted to a Python list of Python float objects via pymalloc arenas — at ~10 Hz this accumulated ~0.15 GB/min RSS. Zero-copy NumPy path eliminates this entirely.

---

## 4. Data Pipeline & Corpus

### Corpus Generation (§5)

`generate_corpus.py`: SealBot self-play, SHA-256 hash-based filenames for deduplication. Random opening injection: 3 random moves (d4) or 1 random move (d6+) before SealBot takes over. Reduced dupe rate 87%→43% at d4. SealBot time cap: 1s/move. Makefile targets: `corpus.fast` (5K games, 0.1s), `corpus.strong` (2.5K games, 0.5s).

### Scraper — white-box API (§21)

`hexo.did.science` = `WolverinDEV/infhex-tic-tac-toe` repo (confirmed). Key findings that drove changes:
- `baseTimestamp` is correct param (not `before`) — fixed
- Public game cap is exactly 500 (not 480) — updated `UNAUTHENTICATED_GAME_LIMIT`
- `/api/leaderboard` exists unauthenticated → `--top-players-only` flag added
- Per-game Elo in `DatabaseGamePlayer.elo` → `player_black_elo`/`player_white_elo` stored in game JSON
- Coordinates are direct axial (q=x, r=y) — no translation needed

Dual-pass `scrape_daily.sh`: standard 500-game pull + top-20 player profile pull. Manifest includes `elo_bands` breakdown. All scraper flags in `configs/corpus.yaml`.

### mmap Corpus Loading — active pattern (§19 + §35)

**Root cause:** `np.load()` (no mmap) + `np.concatenate()` on full corpus (~906K positions) caused ~26 GB peak RAM → system freeze.

**Pattern:**
1. `make corpus.export` produces a 50K-position uncompressed NPZ (`np.savez`, not `savez_compressed`).
   Uncompressed is required — `savez_compressed` defeats `mmap_mode='r'`.
2. Load with `np.load(path, mmap_mode='r')` — OS pages data on demand, RAM stays near-zero.
3. `del pre_states, pre_policies, pre_outcomes` immediately after `push_game()` releases mmap views.
   Keeping views alive for the entire process lifetime was a confirmed ~720 MB leak (§46).

**Warning:** If `bootstrap_corpus.npz` is absent, `load_corpus()` fallback runs and the double-allocation risk returns. **Always run `make corpus.export` before `make pretrain`.**

Config: `corpus_npz_path` in `configs/corpus.yaml`. `mixing.pretrain_max_samples: 200_000` caps corpus even if NPZ is large.

### Pretrain Checkpoint Hygiene (§34)

**Decision: always use `checkpoints/bootstrap_model.pt` as the RL entry point.**

| File | step | scheduler last_epoch | Type | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pretrain/pretrain_00000000.pt` | 0 | ~53K (exhausted) | full checkpoint | **Do not use for RL** — LR ≈ eta_min (1e-5) at start, learns almost nothing. |
| `pretrain/pretrain_00053130.pt` | 53130 | 53130 | full checkpoint | Human-only pretrain reference only. |
| `checkpoints/bootstrap_model.pt` | N/A | N/A | **weights-only** | **Use this for RL.** Fresh optimizer + scheduler from config. |

`bootstrap_model.pt` is weights-only. `Trainer.load_checkpoint` detects this, sets `trainer.step = 0`, constructs fresh scheduler. `make train` already uses this via `CHECKPOINT_BOOTSTRAP` in Makefile.

### Validation Game Count (§20)

Pretrain validation: 100 greedy games vs RandomBot (was 5 — statistically meaningless). 95% CI width at p=0.5 is ±~10% at n=100.

### Sequential Action Space (§6) — confirmed correct

- 2 MCTS plies per 2-stone compound turn
- Q-value sign flips **only at turn boundaries**, not at intermediate ply
- Dirichlet noise skipped at intermediate ply
- Plane 16 encodes `moves_remaining == 2`

---

## 5. Evaluation Pipeline

**Files:** `hexo_rl/eval/`, `configs/eval.yaml`, `configs/training.yaml`

> Forward pointers — current authority:
>
> - Eval determinism (temperature, per-game seeding, random opening plies) added at §80.
> - Two-tier checkpoint retention (rolling + permanent eval steps) added at §84.
> - `probe_threat_logits.py` committed as the step-5k kill criterion at §89. Revised at §91 (C1-C4: contrast + top-5 + top-10 + warning).
> - Graduation gate landed at §101 + §101.a: per-opponent `stride`, CI guard (`ci_lo > 0.5`), 200-game gating, anchor semantics (`inf_model ← best_model`). Supersedes the "50 games vs best" framing below.

- Bradley-Terry MLE (not incremental Elo). scipy L-BFGS-B with L2 regularisation 1e-6 to prevent divergence on perfect records.
- SQLite results store (WAL mode). Full BT recomputation from all historical pairwise data after each eval round.
- Gating rule: new checkpoint promoted if win_rate ≥ 0.55 over 50 games vs best checkpoint.
- Opponents: previous best, SealBot (fixed external Elo reference), RandomBot (sanity floor).
- Evaluation in a separate thread; model cloned (fresh HexTacToeNet) to avoid sharing compiled training model.

**eval_interval arc:** §52 changed 500→2000 (eval was blocking self-play). §60 changed 2000→5000 (at step 2000, SealBot winrate was 0/22; eval took 130 min = 55% of wall-clock). **Final: `eval_interval: 5000`** in `configs/training.yaml`, `best_checkpoint n_games: 50` in `configs/eval.yaml`. At ~490 steps/hr, one eval every ~10 hours = ~9% overhead.

---

## 6. Training Loop & Stability

> Forward pointers — current authority:
>
> - Scheduler bug fixed at §67; `total_steps` and `eta_min` are REQUIRED in config now — no silent 50K/1e-5 fallback. `decay_steps / total_steps ≈ 0.10` rule of thumb post exp A/C.
> - Ownership + threat losses emitted in `training_step` events at §82; chain added at §93 C14.
> - Training stack split into `scripts/train.py` + `hexo_rl/training/{loop, batch_assembly, aux_decode}.py` at §88.
> - FP16 NaN guard (§47) no longer resets BN running stats — §99 replaced BN with GN (no running stats to poison). Retains the `torch.special.entr` + log-clamp fixes.
> - Selective policy loss landed at §100: `full_search_mask` gates policy / opp_reply; value / chain / ownership / threat apply to all rows. Mutex with game-level `fast_prob` enforced at pool init.

### FP16 NaN Guard (§47) — active fix, must not revert

**Root cause chain:**
1. `compute_aux_loss`: policy_prune_frac zeros low-visit entries. Zero target × `log_softmax(-inf)` = `0×-inf = NaN` under FP16.
2. Entropy bonus: `log_policy.exp()` underflows to 0.0 for near-zero probs under FP16, then multiplies `-inf` log entry.
3. BatchNorm contamination: BN running stats updated **during forward pass, before GradScaler**. One poisoned forward NaN's all subsequent passes even if optimizer step is skipped.

**Why GradScaler alone is insufficient:** GradScaler checks `torch.isinf()` on gradients, not `torch.isnan()`. `0×-inf` NaN passes the inf check entirely.

**Fixes:**
- `compute_aux_loss`: clamp log-probs to `min=-100.0` before multiplication.
- Entropy (two sites in trainer.py): replace `-(p * log_p).sum()` with `torch.special.entr(p_fp32).sum()` (defines `0·log(0)≡0`, promotes to FP32 first).
- NaN guard: after `compute_total_loss()`, detect non-finite loss, reset poisoned BN modules, call `scaler.update()`, return early.

### Draw Penalty (§24 → §40)

Initial (§24): `draw_reward: -0.1` (KrakenBot practice for minority-outcome draws). Changed at §40 to `draw_reward: -0.5`.

**Why -0.5:** First overnight run produced 56.6% draws. At 56% frequency, expected draw target = `0.56 × -0.1 = -0.056` — too weak to break the draw-seeking equilibrium. At -0.5 the expected target = -0.280, providing a clear gradient. Once draws become rare, the penalty rarely fires and value distribution naturally re-centres on ±1.0.

### Resume Bugs Fixed (§58) — all three were confirmed in JSONL

**Bug 1 — pretrained stream not initialised on resume:** `if _buffer_restored: ... elif pretrained_path:` structure prevented corpus loading whenever any buffer was restored. Fixed: decoupled the conditions. `pretrained_buffer` always initialised from NPZ when file exists; `_buffer_restored` only controls the `corpus_prefill_skipped` log message.

**Bug 2 — corpus prefill skip threshold too low:** `_buffer_restored = (n_loaded > 0)` meant 1,770 positions skipped the corpus load. Fixed: `_buffer_restored = (n_loaded >= 10_000)`. Below threshold: `corpus_prefill_running` event logged with `reason="buffer_too_small"`.

**Bug 3 — hidden loss terms invisible in JSONL:** `log.info("train_step")` included `total_loss` but omitted `uncertainty_loss`, `ownership_loss`, `threat_loss`. These ARE in `total_loss` (weights 0.05, 0.1, 0.1) and caused apparent spikes (~390+) when uncertainty head initialised randomly on resume. Fixed: all four loss terms individually logged. Residual delta = entropy regularisation (already logged as `policy_entropy`).

### Memory Fixes

- **glibc malloc arenas (§53):** `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` prepended to all training Makefile targets. Without this, glibc creates one 64 MB arena per thread (up to 128 on 16-thread system); arenas never returned to OS → ~+2 GB/hr RSS growth. GPU allocation is unaffected (CUDA allocator).
- **RSS leaks (§46):** (1) `del pre_states, pre_policies, pre_outcomes` after push_game. (2) SocketIO `_safe_emit()` gated on connected SIDs. (3) Pre-allocated batch arrays (`np.copyto` in-place, not `np.concatenate`).
- **Buffer warmup edge case (§50):** `np.copyto` path falls back to `np.concatenate` when buffer underfull (warm-up period < batch_size positions). Flips to in-place permanently after warmup ends.

### Config Growth Reductions (§40b)

Applied during draw-collapse fix session: `buffer_schedule` reduced (100K/250K/500K, was 250K/500K/1M), `standard_sims: 400→200`, `decay_steps: 1_000_000→300_000`.

## 7. Monitoring & Dashboard

**Files:** `hexo_rl/monitoring/`, `configs/monitoring.yaml`

> Forward pointers — current authority:
>
> - `policy_entropy_pretrain` and `policy_entropy_selfplay` split added at §71.2. Collapse threshold 1.5 nats on selfplay stream.
> - `/analyze` policy viewer added at §78 (checkpoint LRU cache, Blueprint, `HexCanvas` ES module).
> - `loss_chain`, `loss_ownership`, `loss_threat` surfaced in both renderers at §93 C14.
> - engineio disconnect `KeyError` swallowed via `threading.excepthook` filter at §91.

### Architecture

Event-driven fan-out: `emit_event(payload)` in `events.py` dispatches to registered renderers. Never raises; renderer failures caught and logged. Zero import side effects.

Renderers registered at startup in `train.py`:
- `TerminalDashboard` — Rich Live 4Hz render
- `WebDashboard` — Flask+SocketIO at `:5001`

Events: `run_start`, `training_step`, `iteration_complete`, `eval_complete`, `game_complete`, `system_stats`, `run_end`.

### Dashboard Enrichment (§63 + §64 + §65)

**`training_step` event additions:**
- `policy_target_entropy`: mean entropy of post-pruning MCTS policy target over batch. Computed only on non-zero-policy rows. Replaces the old `policy_excess` label (§65 fix: policy_excess = KL − H(target) after §61 switched to KL loss — had no guaranteed sign). Renamed to `policy_KL` displaying `loss_policy` directly.

**`iteration_complete` event additions:**
- `mcts_mean_depth`: mean leaf depth per sim across all moves. Accumulated in `select_leaves()` outer loop (not inside `select_one_leaf` traversal) — one count per sim.
- `mcts_root_concentration`: mean of (max_child_visits / root_total_visits) at root per move.

Depths are accumulated as ×1e6 fixed-point in AtomicU64 (first commit had truncation bug using u64 directly — self-corrected within same session before any training ran on it).

**Expected values:** At step ~3,800 with near-uniform priors and 25% fast games, mcts_mean_depth = 2–4 is physically correct. Expect ≥ 5.0 by step 50–70K (decay_steps=300K slows the transition — estimate adjusted accordingly).

**Ring buffer sizes bumped:** `training_step_history: 2000` (was 500), `game_history: 500` (was 200). Values served via `/api/monitoring-config` so SPA doesn't need hardcoding.

### Operational Fixes

- **SocketIO bounded queue (§55):** `put_nowait()` from training thread into `queue.Queue(maxsize=200)`; daemon drain thread does actual `socketio.emit()`. Training loop never blocks. Config: `monitoring.emit_queue_maxsize: 200`.
- **Structlog JSONL sink (§56):** Log file `logs/train_{run_id}.jsonl`. Handle closed in `finally` block **after** all session-end logging (earlier ordering caused `I/O operation on closed file` crash on Ctrl+C).
- **RSS tracking (§45):** `psutil.Process().memory_info().rss` sampled on every GPUMonitor poll cycle, included in `system_stats` as `rss_gb`.
- **grad_norm to structured log (§54):** Unconditional `log.info("train_step", ...)` in `_train_on_batch()` — visible in JSONL even without dashboard.

## 8. Game Viewer

**Files:** `engine/src/board/threats.rs`, `hexo_rl/viewer/engine.py`,
`hexo_rl/monitoring/web_dashboard.py`, `hexo_rl/monitoring/static/viewer.html`,
`configs/monitoring.yaml`

- Sliding-window threat detection on 3 hex axes: empty cells within 6-cell windows where one player has N≥3 stones. Levels: 5=critical (≥5), 4=forced (4), 3=warning (3). Threat cells never overlap with occupied cells (tested). Viewer-only — never called from MCTS or training path.
- Game records written to `runs/<run_id>/games/<game_id>.json` on arrival. In-memory index capped at 50 entries (`monitoring.viewer_max_memory_games`). Disk rotated to `monitoring.viewer_max_disk_games: 1000` oldest-first.
- Viewer URL: `http://localhost:5001/viewer` (during training).
- Features: hex board canvas (pointy-top), threat overlay, MCTS visit heatmap (toggle), value sparkline, scrubber, play-against-model mode.

## 9. Gumbel MCTS Activation & Training Restart (§66) — SUPERSEDED

**Date:** 2026-04-07 (superseded by §67 + §74 + §96)

Historical snapshot kept for forensics. Current state:

- §67 replaced the single-flag approach with named variants (`gumbel_full`, `gumbel_targets`, `baseline_puct`) in `configs/variants/`. Base `configs/selfplay.yaml` has `gumbel_mcts: false, completed_q_values: false`.
- §66 amendment + trainer.py:372 fix: `completed_q_values` is now read from the flat merged config. The C1 KL-loss-dead bug is resolved for all runs after the amendment.
- §74.2 confirmed Gumbel vs PUCT pipeline parity on laptop (batch fill 100% both variants, worker throughput noise-overlapping). Desktop Gumbel behaviour confirmed via §96 exp E (in flight at time of writing).
- §98 supersedes the benchmark baseline reference.

---

## 10. Graduation Gate & Anchor Model

**Files:** `hexo_rl/training/loop.py`, `hexo_rl/eval/eval_pipeline.py`, `hexo_rl/eval/results_db.py`, `configs/eval.yaml`, `configs/training.yaml`

> Current authority: §101 + §101.a. Supersedes "win rate ≥ 55% over N games" framing in §5.

**Anchor semantics.** Self-play workers consume `inf_model` weights. `inf_model` is synced from the `best_model` anchor only at (a) cold-start load and (b) graduation — **never** from drifted `trainer.model` on checkpoint ticks. Between graduations, data quality is monotonic.

**Graduation gate (two-part):**

```
graduated = (wr_best >= promotion_winrate) AND (ci_lo > 0.5)
```

- `promotion_winrate: 0.55` (vs KrakenBot's 0.76 — conservative entry point).
- `require_ci_above_half: true` (§101.a M1) — binomial 95% CI lower bound > 0.5. Cuts false-positive rate from ~9% (point-threshold alone at n=200, p_true=0.5) to <1%.
- `n_games: 200` (binomial 95% CI ±~7% at p=0.55).
- Promotion copies **from `eval_model`** (the snapshot that was actually scored), not from current `trainer.model` — §101.a C1 was the critical bug.

**Eval cadence.** `eval_interval: 2500` base (eval.yaml); `training.yaml` precedence at both trigger and stride-math (§101.a H1). Per-opponent `stride`:

| Opponent | stride | n_games | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `best_checkpoint` | 1 | 200 | graduation gate |
| `sealbot` | 4 | 50 | external benchmark (every 10k steps) |
| `random` | 1 | 20 | sanity floor |

**Cold-start.** No `best_model.pt` → clone from initial `trainer.model` + save. Candidate vs clone ~50% win rate → no spurious promotion.

**Operational invariants.** Resume where `trainer.step != best_model_step` logs `resume_anchor_step_mismatch` (§101.a M2). `eval_complete` payload reports `eval_games` (actually-played count, accounting for stride skips — §101.a M3). Stride-skipped opponents show `None` (not 0.0) on the dashboard (§101.a L2).

**Ratings ladder.** Bradley-Terry MLE over all recorded matches in `reports/eval/results.db` (SQLite, WAL); plot at `reports/eval/ratings_curve.png`. Per-run `run_id` threaded into all 5 DB calls (§68); reference opponents (SealBot, random_bot) use `run_id=""` as shared anchors.

## 11. Playout Cap — Selective Policy Loss

**Files:** `engine/src/game_runner/worker_loop.rs`, `engine/src/replay_buffer/*`, `hexo_rl/training/losses.py`, `configs/selfplay.yaml`

> Current authority: §100 + §100.c. The game-level cap (§43) still exists but is mutually exclusive with the move-level cap.

**Two caps; mutex at pool init (§100.c M1).**

1. **Game-level cap** (§43, legacy) — `playout_cap.fast_prob / fast_sims / standard_sims`. Whole-game fast/standard. Fast-game positions get zero-policy vectors (`sum < 1e-6`) → filtered out of policy loss by `policy_valid` mask. **Default off post-§100** (`fast_prob: 0.0`).
2. **Move-level cap** (§100, active) — per-move coin-flip between full-search and quick-search. Each position tagged with `is_full_search ∈ {0, 1}`. Rust stores the flag as a u8 column in the replay buffer; HEXB v5.

**Loss gating.** `compute_policy_loss`, `compute_kl_policy_loss`, and `compute_aux_loss(opp_reply)` intersect `full_search_mask` with `valid_mask`. Value / chain / ownership / threat losses apply to **all** rows regardless of the flag (their training signal is independent of MCTS sim count).

**Defaults.**

```yaml
playout_cap:
  fast_prob: 0.0          # game-level cap disabled
  full_search_prob: 0.25  # move-level — per-move P(full search)
  n_sims_quick: 100       # quick-search sim budget
  n_sims_full: 600        # full-search sim budget
```

Effective avg sims/move ≈ 0.75·100 + 0.25·600 = **225** (~2.3× compute vs the legacy 98 average from the game-level cap). KrakenBot-matched.

**HEXB v4 compatibility.** v5 adds 1 byte/row (`is_full_search`); v4 buffers load with default flag 1 (all positions treated as full-search — same as disabling move-level cap).

**Telemetry.** `trainer.py` logs `full_search_frac` — fraction of batch rows where **both** `policy_valid` and `full_search_mask` are True. Distinguishes "nothing contributed to policy loss" (mask-empty) from "genuine 0.0 loss" is a known follow-up (§100 "Known follow-ups").

# Part 2 — Operational Record

## Falsified Hypotheses Register

Do not re-litigate. Each row points at the § that closed it.

| § | Hypothesis | Falsified by | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| §154 | v9 hex-trunk closes self-play gap | §154 MCTS-matched eval | Probe gates pass but selfplay drops to 0–1% SealBot WR. Probes cannot validate dynamic equivariance. |
| §155 R10 | Super-additive interaction of 5 smoke MCTS+exploration knobs drives 91% draws | §156 R12 | Cosine temperature alone is load-bearing (~5% draws → ~91%). Dirichlet / opening_plies / playout_cap are synergy partners, not drivers. |
| §169 A4 | Padding semantics (canvas_realness + PartialConv2d) recovers bbox direction | §169 P4 eval | A4 trains to 3.47 loss (below A1 anchor 3.57) but 0% SealBot WR. bbox direction is structural — K-aggregation as cross-cluster contrast, bbox-centroid frame instability, R=8 perception. |
| §170 A2/A3 | Learned PMA pool replaces K-cluster min/max | §169 ablation matrix | A2 4.5% / A3 7.5% WR vs A1 14.5%. A1 K-cluster min/max canonical. |
| §170 P3 gpool-bias-on-all | Gpool-bias as global lever for both policy + value heads | §170 P4 | gpool-bias-policy-only is the load-bearing mechanism; full gpool-bias is NULL on value. |
| pre-§148 | v6 corpus is human-quality (bot mix at uniform weight does not contaminate) | §147 audit | ~41% bot games at source_weight=1.0; Elo weighting degenerated to uniform via rng.choice on uniform weights. v7 human-only Elo-weighted is canonical. |
| §174 e50 | More pretrain epochs improve self-play | §174 closeout | e50 selfplay regressed vs e30 (median 12 vs 17 plies). e50 G4 marginal fail (0.489 vs band 0.462). Value head over-fits to corpus-mode signal that selfplay cannot reproduce. |
| §174 radius compression | LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS 8→5 at bootstrap fixes v6w25 selfplay collapse | §174 R=1..R=8 smoke | Median plies identical across all radii. Radius does not move bootstrap quality. Smokes were already R=8. |
| §174 bootstrap recipe | v6w25 selfplay collapse is a bootstrap recipe issue | §174 closeout | Loss surface normal (3.96 nats vs uniform, matches v7full trajectory). Opening-fraction starvation refuted (16.09% vs 17.15% v6). Collapse is at argmax-degeneracy / selfplay-interaction layer, not corpus/loss. |
| pre-§73 | Dirichlet root noise active on Phase 3.5+ training path | §73 Q17 | Unported at Rust migration. 16,880 steps of carbon-copy self-play (Q17 mode collapse). Fixed in commit `71d7e6e`. |
| pre-§47 | FP16 AMP is numerically robust on aux losses | §47 | 0×−inf cascade in aux CE caused NaN total_loss, BN poisoning. Log-clamp + `torch.special.entr()` fix. |
| pre-§101 C1 | Promoted weights = evaluated weights | §101 C1 | Allocator reuse → every graduation committed unvalidated weights as anchor. Fixed at §101 C1. |
| §169 P0 | A4 collapse is broadcast-scalar-plane dependency | §169a probe | Spatial pathway not dead; collapse is structural at K=1 inference. |
| §131 (pre) | 18-plane input dimensionality is load-bearing | §131 ablation | KEPT_PLANE_INDICES=[0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11] (8 of 18) suffice. Chain moved to aux sub-buffer (§97 line). |
| forced-win short-circuit (pre-baseline) | MCTS expansion-time forced-win detection accelerates training | removed pre-§0 | Network never evaluated near-win positions → no fork learning. Removed; quiescence value-override at leaf-eval is the correct alternative. |
| §171 A4 P2-reopen | Distribution-shift fine-tune over 5% adversarial corpus (frozen-spine) recovers MCTS signal on A4 | §171 A4 P2-reopen C closeout | MCTS-64 0/200 Wilson95 [0%, 1.88%] — DEAD bin cleanly met. Falsifies §169 P0 SPATIAL_RICH for frozen-spine class. |

## Current Authoritative Benchmark Baseline

**2026-04-06 headline rows; worker-throughput + buffer-sample-augmented
rebaselined 2026-04-16 post-§97 18ch migration (§98). Ryzen 7 8845HS +
RTX 4060 Laptop, bench.full n=5, 3s warm-up (90s post-§98 for worker),
LTO+native.**

| Metric | Baseline (median) | Target | IQR |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCTS (CPU only, 800 sims/move × 62 iters) | 55,478 sim/s | ≥ 26,000 sim/s | ±400 |
| NN inference batch=64 | 9,810 pos/s | ≥ 8,500 pos/s | ±1 |
| NN latency batch=1 | 1.59 ms | ≤ 3.5 ms | ±0.05 ms |
| Replay buffer push | 762,130 pos/sec | ≥ 630,000 pos/sec | ±114,320 |
| Buffer sample raw (batch=256) | 1,037 µs/batch | ≤ 1,500 µs | ±34 µs |

| Batch fill % | 100.0% | ≥ 80% | ±0 |

All 10 targets PASS. Methodology: median n=5, 3s warm-up, realistic MCTS workload (800 sims/move × 62 iterations with tree reset), CPU unpinned (n=5 median provides sufficient variance control).

## Benchmark Evolution

| Date | What was wrong | What changed | Impact on targets |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-01 | MCTS workload was burst (50K sims in one tree) — exceeded L2 cache, inflated by boost clocks | Changed to 800 sims/move × 62 iter with tree reset; n=5 median | MCTS target dropped from 160K to realistic steady-state |
| 2026-04-03 | benchmark.py read `config.get('res_blocks')` (top-level) instead of `config['model']['res_blocks']` — measured wrong (smaller) model; VRAM used pynvml global not process-specific; single pool per measurement window included cold-start | Fixed model config path; switched to `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`; keep one warm pool across all measurement windows | Worker throughput baseline corrected 1.18M→735K; NN latency 1.52ms→2.90ms; targets recalibrated |
| 2026-04-04 | Legal move radius corrected bbox+2→radius 8 (~9× branching factor expansion) + FPU behavioral tree shape change | Both are correct behaviour changes, not regressions | MCTS target rebaselined to ≥26K (85% of new ~31K median) |
| 2026-04-09 | NVIDIA driver/boost-clock step-change dropped NN inference and worker throughput ~14% cold/hot/idle, not a code regression | Rebaseline after structured three-run investigation (§72). | NN inference target ≥ 8,500 → ≥ 8,250 pos/s; worker throughput ≥ 625k → ≥ 500k pos/hr |
| 2026-04-16 | 18-channel migration (§97) — chain planes moved out of NN input into a separate replay-buffer sub-buffer. Buffer sample augmented now splits scatter (18 state + 6 chain). Worker benchmark hit a warmup-design artifact (0-position measurement windows). | Rebaseline per §98. Note: real training (GPU shared with gradient steps) delivers ~48k pos/hr at production sim counts — the bench measures self-play-only capacity at reduced sims. | Buffer aug ≤ 1,400 → ≤ 1,800 µs; worker throughput ≥ 500k → ≥ 250k pos/hr |
| 2026-04-22 | `cda9dde` dedup always-on has residual 33 µs cost; `push_many_impl` element-wise `to_bits()` loops caused LLVM codegen spillover regressing push (460k→576k) and sample (1,715→1,533 µs). | `push.rs` transmute fix (`6c0bfa9`) recovered push and aug; sample_raw residual +33 µs is correctness cost of always-on dedup. Recalibrate sample_raw target only. | `buffer_sample_raw` ≤ 1,500 → ≤ 1,550 µs |

## Regressions & Reversions

| Feature | When Added | Reverted | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| SealBot mixed opponent in self-play | §17 (2026-04-02) | Immediately (`c9f39de`) | Python daemon threads caused 3.3× GIL contention regression (1.52M→464K pos/hr). **Do not re-litigate** — GIL regression was an implementation issue, not a conceptual flaw. Re-add post-Phase 4.5 baseline using subprocess-based wrapper to avoid GIL. |
| Forced-win short-circuit (`FormationDetector::has_forced_win()`) | Pre-sprint | Removed (2026-04-02) | MCTS bypassed NN for near-win positions → network never learned to evaluate them. Removing adds ~30% more NN calls/game (batch fill 99.4%→99.82%) but training quality requires it. |
| draw_reward: -0.1 | §24 | Raised to -0.5 at §40 | Not a revert — a correction. -0.1 assumed draws were minority; at 56% draw rate the signal was too weak to break equilibrium. |
| torch.compile | §3 | Disabled §32 | Python 3.14 CUDA graph incompatibility cascade (TLS crash → Triton spike). |
| uncertainty_weight: 0.05 | §33 | Set to 0.0 at §59 | Gaussian NLL diverges when σ²→clamp floor; total_loss spiked to ~394. |
| Chain-length planes in NN input (18→24) | §92 | Reverted to 18 at §97 | Redundant — trunk already predicts chain as aux; KrakenBot achieves top play with 2-channel input. Chain retained as aux target in a separate replay-buffer sub-buffer. |
| BatchNorm throughout trunk | pre-§99 | Replaced with GroupNorm(8) at §99 | BN running stats drift from live distribution during self-play; batch=1 MCTS leaf eval used stale stats. GN computes per-sample statistics. |

## Key Resolved Bugs

| § | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| §26 | Legal move radius bbox+2 instead of radius 8 | ~9× too-small branching factor; invalid MCTS search | Per-stone hex ball iteration |
| §38 | `action_idx` u16 overflow (cap 65,535) | Silent MCTS tree corruption with global axial coords | Widen to u32 |
| §47 | FP16 0×-inf NaN cascade | NaN total_loss, BN poisoning, training halt | Log-clamp aux CE; `torch.special.entr()` for entropy; BN reset guard |
| §58 | Three resume bugs | Pretrained stream silently disabled on resume; hidden loss spikes | Decouple buffer-restore from corpus-load; threshold 10K; log all loss terms |
| §59 | TT memory leak (`new_game()` did not clear TT) | 28 GB RSS after 500 min | `self.transposition_table.clear()` in `new_game()` |
| §73 | Dirichlet root noise never fired on Rust training path (unported at Phase 3.5 migration) | Self-play mode collapse — 16,880 steps of carbon-copy games (Q17) | Port `apply_dirichlet_to_root` into `engine/src/game_runner.rs` (commit `71d7e6e`), both PUCT and Gumbel branches, with intermediate-ply skip. |
| §101 C1 | Promoted weights ≠ evaluated weights | Every graduation committed unvalidated weights as the new anchor | `eval_model` allocated once; promotion branch loads `best_model ← eval_model` (still holding the scored snapshot). |

# Mechanism Lessons

Distilled meta-lessons. Cite a row before re-deriving its rule.

| # | Lesson | Origin |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Corpus quality = model quality floor. Verify corpus completeness BEFORE diagnosing trainer pathology. Silent filter bugs do NOT show in loss curves. | §114, §147 |
| L2 | Probe gates cannot validate dynamic equivariance. Require MCTS-matched eval, not just argmax probes. | §154 v9 falsified |
| L3 | One sole-load-bearing knob is the default; "super-additive interaction of N knobs" is usually wrong. Bisect within the conjunction. | §155 → §156 |
| L4 | The encoding decides; the pool variant tweaks. Training loss alone is NOT a sufficient signal for downstream WR. | §169 ablation matrix |
| L5 | Pool overflow is silent corruption. `expand_and_backup_single` inserting all legal moves caused warned-flag fabricated `is_terminal=true` → poisoned buffer throughout. Top-K expansion (192) sorted by policy prior is the fix. | §127, §128 |
| L6 | Bench metric `positions_pushed` is bimodal (burst artifact). `positions_generated` continuous counter replaces it. Pre-§128 throughput numbers are obsolete. | §128 |
| L7 | Always run bench twice on new hardware; discard first run (CUDA JIT warmup). | §90, §125 |
| L8 | More pretrain epochs is not strictly better. Value-head over-fits to corpus-mode signal that selfplay cannot reproduce. | §174 e50 |
| L9 | Cosine temperature schedule is the load-bearing knob in draw-collapse. Pair with LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS jitter when active. | §156, §157 |
| L10 | Cross-encoding checkpoint loading is brittle. Encoding header in `persist.rs` (§173 HEXB v7) rejects mismatched loads. | §172, §173 |
| L11 | K-cluster encoding has no board-AI precedent but is structural twin of MVCNN view-pooling, SwAV multi-crop, PointNet++ set-abstraction, deep MIL pooling. 12pp gain at matched MCTS perception is structural inductive bias, not TTA. | §170 P4, §167 T2 |
| L12 | Never recalibrate gate thresholds to match failing runs. Never extend smoke runs past stated step limits without explicit go-ahead. | §155, §144 |
| L13 | Subagent prompts include pre-registered pass criteria; implicit done-when causes scope creep. Independent review subagent at sprint close in fresh context, not implementer's. | §170, §171, §172 A9 |
| L14 | Pre-flight cold smoke must use canonical sprint bootstrap, not dev defaults. | §171 P2 |
| L15 | Pre-§148 v6 corpus retired wholesale. All v6-era anchors (Q41 51%, Q52 24%) carry contaminated baseline; do not cite as comparison. | §147, §148 |
| L16 | RegistrySpec by value (~174 B) on MCTS hot path kills `worker_pos_per_hr` ~10%. Use `&'static`, scalar extraction, or `#[inline]` accessors. | §173 A5b |
| L17 | Always grep receiving code before scheduling a sprint item as "one-line config change". §122 rotation "one-liner" was a ~50-80 line port. | §122, §131 |

## §66–§101 — Phase 4.0 foundation (KEEP-DISTILLED per §1–§101 Classification Audit)

### §66 — Gumbel MCTS activation & training restart (SUPERSEDED) — 2026-04-07
SUPERSEDED by §67 (named variants) + §74 (audit) + §96 (Gumbel desktop A/B). C1 KL-loss-dead bug resolved at amendment; affected only loss reporting, not training dynamics. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§066_c1-bug-impact-amendment.md`.

### §67 — LR scheduler bug + total_steps / decay_steps co-design + named Gumbel variants — 2026-04-07
`trainer.py:145` hardcoded `T_max=50_000` fallback collapsed LR to `eta_min=1e-5` at step 50K while bootstrap was still dominant. Fix: `_build_scheduler` raises if `total_steps`/`eta_min` absent. Locked: `total_steps: 200_000`, `eta_min: 2e-4`, `decay_steps: 70_000` (rule of thumb `decay_steps ≈ 0.35 × total_steps`). Three named variants in `configs/variants/`: `gumbel_full` (Gumbel root + CQ), `gumbel_targets` (CQ only), `baseline_puct` (neither). Restart from `bootstrap_model.pt`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§067_lr-scheduler-fix-gumbel-variants.md`.

### §68 — Eval DB run_id bug + broken-run cleanup — 2026-04-07
`EvalPipeline.run_id` was stored but never passed to 5 DB call sites → all runs collapsed onto `run_id=""`. Fix: thread `run_id=self.run_id`. Reference opponents keep `run_id=""` as shared anchors. §67 broken runs archived to `archive/checkpoints.broken-202604/`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§068_*.md`.

### §69 — Config Sweep 2026-04-08 — PUCT/Gumbel knob ranking — HISTORICAL
Superseded by §90 throughput baseline. 15+1 runs on laptop varied `training_steps_per_game`, `max_train_burst`, `max_game_moves`, `inference_max_wait_ms`, `leaf_batch_size`, `inference_batch_size`, `n_workers`, `gumbel_m`. **P3 winner config remains live** (tsp=1.5, burst=16). Full sweep data: `archive/sweep_2026-04-08/`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§069_*.md`.

### §70 — Phase 4.0 overnight run: mode collapse diagnosis — 2026-04-09 → 2026-04-10
**RESOLVED at §73**. Root cause: Dirichlet root noise was wired through Python `SelfPlayWorker` (eval/benchmark) but unported to `engine::SelfPlayRunner` at the 2026-03-30 Rust migration. 30/30 trace records `site: game_runner`, 0/30 `site: apply_dirichlet_to_root`. MCTS rubber-stamped a sharp prior → deterministic fixed point → no gradient signal. Dashboard `policy_entropy` averaged pretrain stream with collapsed selfplay stream, masking collapse for 16,880 steps. Restart from `bootstrap_model.pt`. Forensics: `archive/diagnosis_2026-04-10/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§070_*.md`.

### §71 — Pre-Dirichlet-fix cleanup + Gumbel fallback verification — 2026-04-10
Gumbel SH functionally active on training path (30 trace records, `top_visit_fraction` 0.24 vs PUCT 0.65 — Sequential Halving spreads budget). `policy_entropy_pretrain` / `policy_entropy_selfplay` split landed; collapse threshold 1.5 nats on selfplay stream. Pre-run checklist (10 items) walked before next sustained. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§071_*.md`.

### §72 — Bench rebaseline: NVIDIA driver/boost-clock step-change — 2026-04-09
Three `bench.full` runs failed same two §66 targets (NN inference ~8,370 vs 8,500; worker throughput ~541k vs 625k). Cold/hot/idle ruled out thermals (49°C). Root cause: `DynamicPowerManagement=3` driver settled GPU into lower boost-clock bin; NN latency 1.59ms → 1.77-1.80ms (~14%). Rebaselined: NN inference ≥ 8,250 pos/s, worker throughput ≥ 500,000 pos/hr. Treat as hardware-state drift. Forensics: `archive/bench_investigation_2026-04-09/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§072_*.md`.

### §73 — Dirichlet root noise ported to Rust training path — 2026-04-10 (Q17 RESOLVED)
Commit `71d7e6e`. New `engine/src/mcts/dirichlet.rs` (Gamma-normalize sampler, `rand_distr 0.5`). `engine/src/game_runner.rs` calls `apply_dirichlet_to_root` on every turn boundary, both PUCT (line 550) and Gumbel (line 465) branches, with intermediate-ply skip (`moves_remaining==1 && ply>0`). Verification: 10 unique noise vectors at cm=0, top-1 prior `0.540 → 0.412`, top-1 visit fraction `0.474` vs §70 baseline `0.65` (−17.6pp). Tests: 108 Rust + 646 Python pass. Forensics: `archive/dirichlet_port_2026-04-10/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§073_*.md`.

### §74 — Gumbel vs PUCT loop audit — 2026-04-10
Three sub-resolutions: §74.1 `get_improved_policy` is PUCT-tree-safe (reads only fields populated by shared expand/backup primitives; unblocks `/analyze` on PUCT trees + Gumbel training targets on PUCT-built trees). §74.2 paired benchmark — batch_fill 100% for both variants on laptop 4060 (16 workers); cross-worker coalescing absorbs per-worker fragmentation; +9.4% Gumbel lead inside noise floor (IQR 39-46%). §74.3 Dirichlet parity regression test (`engine/tests/dirichlet_parity.rs`, 4 tests covering sum-to-one, linear blend, ε=0 noop, intermediate-ply gate). No code change to `game_runner.rs`. Forensics: `reports/gumbel_vs_puct_loop_audit_2026-04-09/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§074_*.md`.

### §77 — MCTS depth & ZOI scope — 2026-04-11
ZOI is post-search only (operates on root visit-count vector for move selection). MCTS tree expands with full radius-8 legal set at all depths. Measured at 200 sims: 360 root children created, 7 receiving visits (B_eff=6.1); mean leaf depth 2.92 plies; top-5 visit share 0.97. Decision: Option A (do nothing) — depth improves automatically as policy sharpens; correct lever is `n_sims` not tree pruning. `docs/01_architecture.md` §36 amended. Forensics: `reports/mcts_depth_investigation_2026-04-11/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§077_*.md`.

### §80 — Eval determinism fix: temperature + random openings — 2026-04-12
Root cause: `Evaluator` constructed `ModelPlayer` without `temperature` arg → defaulted to 0.0 → one-hot argmax → all 50 games bit-identical, BT CIs ±100K. Fix: `eval_temperature: 0.5`, per-game `np.random.seed(seed_base + i)`, `eval_random_opening_plies: 4` (random plies for both sides). Training path untouched. Old behaviour restored via `eval_temperature: 0.0`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§080_*.md`.

### §84 — Eval checkpoint retention (two-tier) — 2026-04-13
Storm: `checkpoint_interval=500 × max_checkpoints_kept=10 = eval_interval=5000` → every eval ckpt evicted by next eval (DB has BT ratings but weight files gone). Fix: `preserve_eval_checkpoints: true` default; `prune_checkpoints()` accepts `preserve_predicate` lambda exempting steps matching `s % eval_interval == 0`. Test `test_eval_checkpoints_not_pruned` pins the contract. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§084_*.md`.

### §85 — A1 aux target alignment (Python + Rust) — 2026-04-13
Three compounding A1 subproblems: (1) `get_aux_targets()` pulled aux from a 200-entry game-level ring with independent random indices (no relation to batch indices); (2) one aux map per game broadcast across ~60 rows; (3) aux maps projected to game-end bbox centroid, replay rows to per-row cluster window centre (offsets ±9 cells). Fix Option A: per-row `ownership` + `winning_line` u8 columns reprojected at game end using each row's `(cq, cr)`; `apply_sym` extended for 12-fold scatter consistency; `sample_batch` 5-tuple → 6-tuple. ReplayBuffer +722 B/row. Rust commit `faafc43`; Python this entry. Kill criterion **revised at §91** (C1-C4 contrast + top-K). Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§085_*.md`.

### §86 — Structural split of `replay_buffer/` + `game_runner.rs` — 2026-04-13
Pure refactor. `replay_buffer/mod.rs` 1,102 → split into `{mod,storage,push,sample,persist,sym_tables}.rs`. `game_runner.rs` 1,313 → split into `game_runner/{mod,worker_loop,gumbel_search,records}.rs`. PyO3 surface stable. `Cargo.toml` feature wiring: `default = ["extension-module"]`, `test-with-python` escape hatch. 113 Rust tests pass with zero body modifications. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§086_*.md`.

### §88 — Python training stack refactor — 2026-04-13
`scripts/train.py` 1,132 → 319 LOC (CLI + config + build core objects → `run_training_loop`). New modules: `hexo_rl/training/aux_decode.py` (69), `batch_assembly.py` (297), `loop.py` (680). `trainer.py` 746 → 720. Public API stable. 119 Rust + 676 Python tests pass. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§088_*.md`.

### §89 — Threat-logit probe committed as step-5k kill criterion — 2026-04-13 (REVISED §91)
`scripts/probe_threat_logits.py` + `tests/test_probe_threat_logits.py` + `fixtures/threat_probe_positions.npz` (20 curated positions) + `fixtures/threat_probe_baseline.json`. Make targets: `probe.bootstrap`, `probe.latest`, `probe.fixtures`. FP32 forced, `torch.manual_seed(42)`, deterministic. **Criterion locked at §91** (C1 contrast + C2/C3 top-K + C4 warning-only). Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§089_*.md`.

### §90 — GPU util sweep: inf_bs / wait_ms levers exhausted — 2026-04-13
`(inf_bs, wait_ms)` sweep A=(64,4), B=(128,8), C=(128,4). Bottleneck is NN forward latency (12.5ms live vs 1.6ms bench), not batcher config. Raising inf_bs grows mean batch but forwards/sec collapses (workers can't supply 128 leaves in same wall-clock). **pos/hr is NOT a sufficient summary** when game length shifts — future sweeps must report steps/hr. Architectural levers (CUDA streams, process split, `torch.compile` re-enable) deferred to Q18. Forensics: `archive/sweep_2026-04-13_gpu_util/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§090_*.md`.

### §91 — Threat-probe criterion revised: colony-spam, not BCE drift — 2026-04-14
§85/§89 C1 (`ext_logit_mean ≥ baseline − 1.0`) was a BCE scale-drift detector misfiring on healthy runs (ckpt_00014344: contrast +3.94 IMPROVED while abs logits drifted globally negative — opposite of ckpt_19500). Replaced with **C1 contrast floor + C2 top-5 + C3 top-10**; C4 warning-only. `BASELINE_SCHEMA_VERSION` 2 → v6 later (real fixture, §106). Q19 `pos_weight ≈ 59` flagged for §92. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§091_*.md`.

### §92 — Q13 + Q13-aux + Q19 atomic landing (PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED §97) — 2026-04-14
56-file atomic commit: 18→24 plane break, chain-length post-placement semantics, `aux_chain_weight=1.0`, threat `pos_weight=59`, HEXB v2 → v3. Pretrain v3 broken by F1 augmentation bug — fixed at §93 v3b. **§97 reverted chain planes from NN input** (chain stays as aux target in dedicated sub-buffer); design decisions survive. Q21 (wider-window aux) parked. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§092_*.md`.

### §93 — Q13 fix-up + F1 root cause + pretrain v3b — 2026-04-15
10-commit fix-up on `feat/q13-chain-planes`. F1: `_apply_hex_sym` had two bugs — no `axis_perm` remap on planes 18..23 + `(col=q,row=r)` vs `(row=q,col=r)` convention mismatch. Fix: route pretrain augmentation through Rust `apply_symmetries_batch`. F3 tensor-buffer parity guard caught real divergence but in dead code (`TensorBuffer` only called by Python `SelfPlayWorker.play_game` — production uses Rust `SelfPlayRunner`); deleted at C9.5. v3b: 15 epochs, policy_loss 2.18, value_loss 0.50, 100/100 vs RandomBot. **Threat probe baseline v4**. Forensics: `reports/q13_fix_26_04_15.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§093_*.md`.

### §94 — Experiment A: `aux_chain_weight=0` fresh run — 2026-04-15
Result: 47.7% draw rate at step 10312 vs smoke_v3b 44.7% at 5003. Chain aux confirmed **NOT primary draw-collapse driver**. Forces §95 (input ablation). Forensics: `reports/smoke_v3b_5k_26_04_15.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§094_*.md`.

### §95 — Experiment C: chain-plane INPUT ablation — 2026-04-16
Audit confirmed chain planes computed at encode-time + stored, NOT recomputed at sample-time; zero planes are symmetry-invariant. Design: zero planes 18-23 after H2D decode (don't remove from architecture). `zero_chain_planes: bool` config flag. Wired in trainer, inference_server, probe_threat_logits. 5 tests. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§095_*.md`.

### §96 — Experiment E: Gumbel MCTS desktop (vs laptop Exp D PUCT+CQ) — 2026-04-16
Hardware: Ryzen 3700x + RTX 3070 (desktop). Variant `gumbel_full`. Bootstrap v3b. Kill conditions relaxed per Exp D learnings. Q26 [WATCH]: nested `training:` block in `gumbel_targets_desktop.yaml` not picked up by deep-merger. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§096_*.md`.

### §97 — Remove chain planes from NN input: 24ch → 18ch — 2026-04-16
KrakenBot architectural alignment. Chain learned via aux loss, not input ingestion. Removed redundancy. `GameState.to_tensor()` returns (K, 18, 19, 19); `HexTacToeNet.in_channels: 24 → 18`. Rust replay buffer chain planes moved to separate `chain_planes` sub-buffer (`6 × 361 × u16` per slot); HEXB v3 → v4. `sample_batch` returns 6-tuple. `apply_chain_symmetry` separate pass with `axis_perm` remap. Old HEXB v1-v3 buffers incompatible. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§097_*.md`.

### §98 — Bench rebaseline post-18ch migration — 2026-04-16
Two failures: buffer_sample_augmented 1,663 µs (≤ 1,400 target) — real regression from split-pass scatter (state 18 + chain 6, two non-contiguous regions); worker_throughput 30,893 pos/hr (≥ 500K target) — warmup design bug (30s insufficient on laptop; p25=0 means at least 2/5 windows measured 0 positions). Rebaselined: `buffer_sample_aug ≤ 1,800 µs`; `worker_throughput ≥ 250,000 pos/hr` (PROVISIONAL — needs longer warmup). Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§098_*.md`.

### §99 — BatchNorm → GroupNorm(8) migration — 2026-04-16
Motivation: BN running stats drift from live distribution during self-play; batch=1 MCTS leaf eval uses stale stats. KrakenBot uses GN(8, 128) throughout. `_GN_GROUPS=8` module constant; `policy_bn` + `opp_reply_bn` removed (2 output channels too few for GN). `normalize_model_state_dict_keys` raises `RuntimeError` on pre-GN key patterns (prevents silent trunk corruption via `strict=False`). **BREAKS pre-§99 checkpoints**; retrain from scratch. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§099_*.md`.

### §100 — Selective policy loss (move-level playout cap) — 2026-04-16
Per-move coin-flip between full-search (600 sims) and quick-search (100 sims); each position tagged `is_full_search ∈ {0,1}`. Policy + opp_reply losses gated on flag in Python; value/chain/ownership/threat apply to all rows. HEXB v4 → v5 (+1 u8/row, flag not under symmetry). §100.c review fixes: H1 RecentBuffer carries flag; H2 BN→GN auto-migration reverted (numerically wrong); M1 mutex (`fast_prob > 0` AND `full_search_prob > 0` raises at pool init); M3 opp_reply gated. **Defaults: `fast_prob: 0.0`, `n_sims_quick: 100`, `n_sims_full: 600`, `full_search_prob: 0.25`** (avg ~225 sims/move ≈ KrakenBot). §100.d threat probe baseline regenerated v4 → v5 against live bootstrap. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§100_*.md`.

### §101 — Graduation gate with anchor model — 2026-04-16
Self-play workers consume `inf_model`. `inf_model` syncs from `best_model` anchor only at (a) cold-start and (b) graduation — **never** from drifted `trainer.model` on checkpoint ticks. Monotonic data quality between graduations. Gate: `wr_best ≥ promotion_winrate (0.55)` AND `ci_lo > 0.5`. §101.a review fixes: **C1 promoted weights ≠ evaluated weights** — `eval_model` allocated once in outer scope; promotion loads `best_model ← eval_model`. H1 `eval_interval` reads from `training.yaml` override. M1 `require_ci_above_half` default true (drops false-positive rate <1% vs ~9% naïve). M2 `resume_anchor_step_mismatch` warning. `_sync_weights_to_inf()` (wrong-direction) deleted. Per-opponent stride: `best=1 n=200 / sealbot=4 n=50 / random=1 n=20`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§101_*.md`.

## §103–§157 — Phase 4.0/Phase B' arc (KEEP-DISTILLED)

### §103 — Corpus zero-chain fix + `baseline_puct` playout-cap pin — 2026-04-17
Two drift bugs from §97/§100. §103.a: `load_pretrained_buffer` padded corpus chain planes with `np.zeros((T,6,19,19))` → chain head pulled toward zero on pretrain fraction of every mixed step. Fix: compute chain planes from stored stone planes 0,8 at NPZ load; route /6 normalisation through float32. §103.b: `baseline_puct.yaml` had no `playout_cap` override → inherited post-§100 `full_search_prob: 0.25`, silently §100-selective. Pin `playout_cap.full_search_prob: 0.0`. Tests `test_corpus_chain_target.py`, `test_baseline_puct_pins_pre_100_semantics`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§103_*.md`.

### §104 — D-Gumbel / D-Zeroloss instrumentation — 2026-04-17
Monitoring-only; no behavior change. `compute_policy_target_metrics` returns 7 fields split by `is_full_search`. Single `.cpu().tolist()` over 7 packed scalars replaces 7 `.item()` syncs (<200 µs/call on CUDA at B=256, A=362). NaN as first-class signal. Gate `monitoring.log_policy_target_metrics: true`. **D-Gumbel verdict: Option A** — quick-search CQ targets drift toward uniform (ΔH +3.5 nats, above +1.5 threshold); §100 selective gate correctly discards. `gumbel_full.yaml` Option A landed: `fast_prob: 0.25 → 0.0`. Resolves §100 known follow-up 3. Forensics: `reports/gumbel_target_quality_2026-04-17.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§104_*.md`.

### §105 — Q27 perspective-flip smoke: W1 necessary, not sufficient — 2026-04-18 → 2026-04-19 (SUPERSEDED §106)
**Postscript:** §106 supersedes. C2/C3 20%/20% identical-FAIL was a synthetic-fixture artifact, not training pathology. The correctness argument for W1 (commit `e9ebbb9`, three call sites that failed `parent.moves_remaining==1` Q-negation — `get_improved_policy`, Gumbel score, `get_top_visits`) stands independently. Two-machine smoke (laptop pre_fix `723615e` vs desktop post_fix `a7efa78`), 5K steps each from `bootstrap_model.pt`. Forensics: `reports/q27_perspective_flip_smoke_2026-04-18/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§105_*.md`.

### §112 — Q33-C2 augmentation discriminator (E1 confirmed) — 2026-04-21
Unblocks §111 HALT. `feat(training): expose augment as training.augment config knob` (commit `eb17389`). Two 25-min smokes from `checkpoint_00017000.pt`, `w_pre=0`. **Result: |Δpe_Q4| = 0.049 ≪ 0.5 threshold** — augmentation-off does NOT reduce `pe_self`. **Verdict E1: pe_self ≈ 5.4 fixed point is self-play-distribution behaviour, not a 12-fold augmentation rotation bug.** Q33 / Q37 **RESOLVED (non-pathology)**. Phase 4.5 unblocked on pe_self premise. Config knob `training.augment: true` (default) with hard `ValueError` on missing key at loop entry. Forensics: `reports/q33c2_augmentation_discriminator_2026-04-21.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§112_*.md`.

### §114 — bootstrap-v4: full-corpus retrain + eval (SUPERSEDED §148) — 2026-04-22
**L1, L15 origin.** Two silent corpus bugs found post-§70/§85: (1) `POSITION_END=50` truncation in `export_corpus_npz.py` discarded all ply ≥ 50 (~40% of positions); bootstrap was endgame-blind. (2) `update_manifest.py` read `player_black_elo`/`player_white_elo` (old format), missed `players[].elo` — 5694/5706 games unrated; Elo-weighted sampling effectively off. Fix sequence: `aa16624` Elo fallback; `ddd408f` drop POSITION_END cap (305,410 positions); `8b446c5` POSITION_END=150 (P95.5, trims time-scramble). Eval v4: C1 contrast +0.36, H2H WR 67%, SealBot WR 18.7% (n=150). Retcons Q17: Dirichlet (§73) was necessary but corpus completeness was the structural fix. **Rule: verify corpus before tuner**. Superseded by v5 (§118), v6 (§134), v7 (§148), v7full (§150). Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§114_*.md`.

### §116 — D-ladder investigation + torch.compile retry + landing/revert — 2026-04-23 → 2026-04-24
**D-ladder (curr_10k catastrophic forgetting).** Verdict: P-regressed (distributional), V intact on corpus. D1 curr WR ex-draws 6%; D2 deep matched 4% (deep regression); D3 KL on corpus 0.181 (close); D4 V MSE ratio 1.027 (matched). Mismatch = distributional. Smoking gun: D3-extra early-game synthetic probe — empty board curr argmax agreement with boot = 0%; ply 2-7 curr entropy 5.47-5.70 (≈ uniform). Curr forgot how to open. Hypothesis: replay buffer under-covered early-game positions during sustained run. Revert live ckpt to `bootstrap_model.pt`. Forensics: `reports/investigations/diag_D_20260423/`.

**torch.compile retry GO.** Both §32 blockers resolved on PT 2.11 + Py 3.14: TLS crash gone, Triton 27 GB spike gone (59.5 MB peak). reduce-overhead: 1.50× throughput / 1.87× latency vs eager, 6.4 s compile. **§116.a landing on master (`1e2d82b` + `41ffad5` resume/OptimizedModule fixes), then REVERTED (`e102a0a`)** after second resume deadlock at step 6002 (futex_do_wait on 78 threads — trainer+inference dual-JIT contention). Mode-plumbing + OptimizedModule unwrap fixes stay. **Re-enable preconditions:** deadlock repro harness OR compile-sequencing OR training-loop smoke. Forensics: `reports/investigations/torch_compile_retry_20260423/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§116_*.md`.

### §117 — TF32 + channels_last probe + per-host autodetect — 2026-04-23
**L7 corollary.** Four-arm matrix × two hosts. TF32 cross-host divergent: sm_89 (4060) −5.8% latency; sm_86 (3070) +5.9% (FP32-tail Linears route to small-K TF32 kernel that serializes poorly). channels_last −7 to −17% on both (SE block `s.view(b,c,1,1)` breaks CL propagation 12× per forward). **Decision: TF32 per-host autodetect (`_TF32_MEASURED: sm_86→False, sm_89→True`); channels_last rejected.** Replaces unconditional `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("high")`. Forensics: `reports/investigations/tf32_channels_last_20260423/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§117_*.md`.

### §118 — Early-game forgetting fix wave — 2026-04-23 → 2026-04-24
**Verdict — root cause:** `pe_self ≈ 5.4` is self-play-starvation rate on **off-canonical** early-game positions, not policy collapse. Under prod (`decay_steps=20000`, `full_search_prob=0.25`), only ~13% of batch policy-gradient came from fresh SP rows; ply 2-7 off-canonical drifted toward `log(N_legal)`. **Axis is canonical vs off-canonical, not ply depth.** Smoke discriminator: A fsp=0.5 → 26% SP-grad share, H 3.97; B decay=2500 → 17.6%, H 3.32. Landed: `early_game_entropy` 10-pos probe; `selfplay.random_opening_plies: 4`; `dirichlet_alpha: 0.3 → 0.05`; `full_search_prob: 0.25 → 0.5`; `pretrain_max_samples: 200_000 → 0`. Phase 5 validation (bootstrap-v5, step 6000): early_game_entropy 3.55 (gate <4.0), threat C1 +3.44, throughput +10%. Q8/Q33/Q37 framing flipped to "sampling-rate starvation". Forensics: `reports/investigations/phase5_validation_20260424/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§118_*.md`.

### §119 — Main-Island Neglect: mechanism located, RecentBuffer augmentation gap — 2026-04-25
User-flagged visual pattern: parallel horizontal formations at equidistant spacing, main island neglected. **5-hypothesis discriminator cascade.** D1 history ordering RULED OUT (10% counterfactual disagreement). D2 windowing coverage RULED OUT (100% largest-group coverage). D3/D4 rotation equivariance PARTIAL (board-coord agreement 51.5% — model is axis-asymmetric but doesn't explain E-W preference). **D5 trajectory: self-play E-W axis share 65% vs corpus 38% (+27pp).** D6 augmentation audit MECHANISM CLOSED: RecentBuffer rows are sampled at Python call site without `apply_sym` LUTs; at step >10k RecentBuffer contributes ~67% of batch → 67% of policy-gradient rows see identity-only symmetry coverage → absolute-position FC policy head learns axis-asymmetric features freely. **Causal chain**: un-augmented RecentBuffer → asymmetric features → axis-biased MCTS → axis-biased trajectories → buffer reinforces 67%. Decision: Option A (augment RecentBuffer in §120). Methodology lesson: when visual pattern is stable + geometrically specific, treat geometry as falsifiable hypothesis first. Forensics: `reports/investigations/main_island_d{1..6}/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§119_*.md`.

### §121 — Directional bias resolves, clustering magnitude is architectural — 2026-04-25
Seven diagnostics (D10-D16) closed mechanism account of axis-clustering. **Two independent components**: (1) Directional heuristic (within-turn, rotation-equivariant) — model places 2nd stone far W of 1st (W=38.2% selfplay vs corpus 12-14%); washes out under D16 rotation probe (W=12.3%, W/E=0.96). Fixed by **permanent self-play rotation from ply 0** (landed §130). (2) Clustering magnitude (cross-turn, rotation-invariant) — aggregate axis density 0.60 per axis doesn't shift under rotation; learned strategic prior "identify axis early and cluster"; preserved by rigid transformation. **Architectural**: trunk lacks inductive bias for hex-axis strategies at right abstraction level. §120 RecentBuffer augmentation closed symmetry gap (~4.7/12 → 12/12 elements per batch row) but cannot correct relational biases. Methodology lesson: split signal (different components resolve differently) is more informative than uniform PASS/FAIL. §122 opens for architectural redesign. Forensics: `reports/investigations/phase121_d{10..16}*/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§121_*.md`.

### §124 — InferenceServer dispatch fix: TorchScript trace + bench methodology shift — 2026-04-25
**L17 corollary.** TorchScript-trace `InferenceServer.forward` at `__init__` via `torch.jit.trace`; gated by `selfplay.trace_inference` (default true); falls back to untraced module if trace raises (e.g. compile-wrapped). ScriptModule shares parameter storage so `load_state_dict_safe` propagates without re-tracing. Merges D2H (`cat(probs, value)` → single `.cpu().numpy()`). Eliminates ~32.6% CPython `nn.Module._call_impl` dispatch cost per forward (py-spy 200Hz, 180s, n_workers=10, 3070). **+34% pos/hr on 3070.** Trace neutral on EPYC 4080S (still GPU-bound). Why trace not compile: simpler (no Dynamo guard, no cudagraph TLS, no Triton spike); ~matches compile throughput on GPU-bound HW while lifting dispatch-bound HW. `make bench` switches to compile OFF + trace ON as production gate; `make bench.compile` retained for engineering datum. NN inference target lowered 6,500 → 4,000 pos/s. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§124_*.md`.

### §125 — EPYC 4080S sweep verdict + py-spy → perf_timing — 2026-04-25
**L7 origin.** Validate sweep on EPYC 7702 + 4080S: `n_workers=24, batch=192, wait=4ms, leaf=8, burst=16` → 377k pos/hr. n_workers=16 regressed 388k → 234k with trace (workers can't refill 192-batch before GPU drains). py-spy 0.4.2 does not support Py 3.14 — replaced with `diagnostics.perf_timing: true` (per-batch fetch_wait_us / h2d_us / forward_us / d2h_scatter_us). **Profile result (n_workers=24, batch=192, trace ON):** forward = 80.4% of cycle (p50 11.96 ms). EPYC 4080S is **GPU-compute-bound, not dispatch-bound** — 3070 py-spy extrapolation was wrong. Next lever: torch.compile on top of trace (compile fuses CUDA kernels trace cannot); stack path `torch.compile(model).then(jit.trace(compiled._orig_mod, ex))` verified possible, not yet implemented. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§125_*.md`.

### §127 — Top-K leaf cap eliminates MCTS pool overflow — 2026-04-28
**L5 origin.** 5090 96-thread sweep saw `mcts_pool_overflow_count > 0` every cell. Root cause: leaf expansion created one child per legal move; once 100+ stones spread out, radius-8 hex ball per stone unions into 1k+ cells; worst-case nodes per search = `n_sims × leaf_batch × n_legal` blew past `MAX_NODES = 1M`. Pre-existing mitigation (fabricate `is_terminal=true` with quiescence-corrected NN value via AtomicU64 counter) was a **hot-path silent-corruption sink** — biased visit counts and value targets, contaminated runs dropped after the fact. Fix: `MAX_CHILDREN_PER_NODE: usize = 192` (sorted by NN policy prior desc, tie-break flat_idx asc — deterministic regardless of FxHashSet order). Fast path with no sort when `legal_moves.len() ≤ K`. Fabricated-terminal removed entirely; counter retained for telemetry, then panic. **Bound**: `400 × 8 × 192 ≈ 614k slots fits 1M` (~38% headroom). Tests in `mcts/mod.rs` + `engine/tests/pool_overflow.rs`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§127_*.md`.

### §128 — Bench metric `positions_generated` replaces `positions_pushed` — 2026-04-28
**L6 origin.** `worker_pos_per_hr` measured via `pool.positions_pushed` which increments by K cluster views × 1 per ply at **game completion** (batch write). 120s window vs ~160s game → most windows capture zero completions → bimodal IQR 80.9%. `positions_generated` is per-ply continuous AtomicUsize — continuous, no burst, stable. Relationship: `positions_pushed = K_avg × positions_generated`, K_avg ≈ 7 empirically. Targets updated: CUDA 142,000 → 20,000; MPS 200,000 → 25,000; CPU 80,000 → 11,000. Desktop n=5 baseline: 27,835 pos/hr IQR ±8.6%, all 5 runs unimodal. **Pre-§128 throughput numbers obsolete**. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§128_*.md`.

### §131 — 18 → 8 plane migration (P1+P2+P3) — 2026-04-29
**KEPT_PLANE_INDICES = [0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11]** (cur ply-0..3 + opp ply-0..3 in 18-plane space; positions 0-7 in 8-plane). Ply-4..7 history + scalar metadata dropped. Dense > sparse for `ckpt_14000` conditioning surface preservation. STATE_STRIDE 6498 → 2888. Chain_planes unchanged at 6 planes. **P1 Rust**: `N_PLANES: 18→8`, HEXB v5 → v6 with `n_planes` header validation, slice-on-push integration; inference path untouched. **P2 Python**: `BUFFER_CHANNELS=8`; `pool.py` `_feat_len = 2888`; `batch_assembly.py` 8→18 scatter bridge in `_train_on_batch` (temporary). Corpus regenerated 1,090,296 positions `(N,8,19,19)`. **P3 Model**: `HexTacToeNet.in_channels: 18→8`; hard-reject guard `trunk.input_conv.weight.shape[1] == 18 → RuntimeError`; bridge block removed; `InferenceBatcher`/`SelfPlayRunner` defaults 6498 → 2888; `worker_loop.rs` `slice_kept_planes_18_to_8` deleted (encode sites call `encode_state_to_buffer_channels` directly). 958 py + 138 rs lib + 35 rs integration pass. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§131_*.md`.

### §137 — W3 validation gates: Q41 WARN + Q52 PASS + Q44 done → Phase 4.0 UNBLOCKED — 2026-04-30
Q41 v6 vs v5 H2H (n=200): 102/200 (51.0%), Wilson [44.1%, 57.8%] — WARN (near-parity). Old gate `lower-CI ≥ 50%` fired even at exact parity; **revised**: PASS ≥ 48%, WARN [43%, 48%), BLOCK < 43%. Q52 v6 vs SealBot (n=150): 36/150 (24.0%) Wilson [17.9%, 31.4%] — **PASS** (gate ≥ 14%). Beats v4 anchor 18.7% by +5.3pp. **Colony-win fraction: 5.6% vs v4's 82%** — low colony fraction is **POSITIVE** (colony wins caused self-play training explosion; §131 channel cut dropped colony-related planes; v6 wins via 6-in-a-row). Q44 laptop bench refloor: 33,174 pos/hr (+19% vs desktop §128). Phase 4.0 UNBLOCKED. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§137_*.md`.

### §141 — W4C policy-head diagnosis: policy intact, locus is search/encoding — 2026-05-01
ckpt_5500 (W4C smoke §138) recorded 1.3% SealBot WR vs bootstrap-v6's 24%. §139-§140 cleared value head + rotation LUT. **Policy probe (n=200 × 5 metrics × 4 categories × 2 models)**: H(p) decreased on real positions (sharpened, not flattened — falsifies Hypothesis A); Spearman ρ ≥ 0.66 on corpus/sealbot/threat; top-1 agreement ≥ 64%; threat extension prob retained at 94% of bootstrap. Colony positions diverged (top-1 agreement 18.5%, rank 201/362) — desired §137 behaviour, not defect. **Verdict: policy head NOT regression locus.** Protocol fixes (pretrain floor 0.1→0.5, max_game_moves 200→100) unlikely to help. Self-play board-extent 329 cells, NN window 19×19 (±9) — most board invisible. Locus: **search/encoding boundary**. Forensics: `reports/w4c_diag/policy_diagnosis.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§141_*.md`.

### §142 — Encoding-window coverage audit: ply-31 fragmentation pivot — 2026-05-01
ckpt_5500 selfplay crosses 19×19 single-window boundary at **ply 31** (median pct_outside 0% → 21.9%, sharp). Any-cluster windowing delays onset but doesn't prevent: 8/16 draws end with ≥80% of stones invisible. End-of-game single-window blindness median 97.7% on draws. **Pathology is distribution-endogenous** — against SealBot (5 games) max ply 29, 0% outside throughout; fragmentation only emerges when two mutually permissive policies play each other. Axis: q (NE-SW) consistent with §138 axis_density. **Recommendation: Option γ (tighten exploration)** — Option α (cap LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS) is fallback. Forensics: `reports/w4c_diag/encoding_audit.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§142_*.md`.

### §146 — Option α' implementation: cap LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS 8 → 5 — 2026-05-02
`engine/src/board/moves.rs:9` `LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS: 8 → 5`. CLUSTER_THRESHOLD untouched (still 8 — governs colony adjacency). Tests: 216 → 90 (single-stone hex ball: 91-1), new `legal_move_radius_capped_at_5`. Laptop smoke (21 games, bootstrap-v6, gumbel_full): draw_rate 0/21, mean game length 16 plies (R=8 was ~110). With p=0.2 the n=0 draws prob is 0.9% — real shift. **Bandaid; SUPERSEDED at §156 (cosine-temp is the real load-bearing knob).** Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§146_*.md`.

### §147 — Bootstrap corpus contamination audit — 2026-05-03
**L1, L15 origin.** Pre-§148 audit of `data/bootstrap_corpus.npz` (v6) found it was generated by `make corpus.export` (all sources), NOT `make corpus.export.pretrain` (human-only). `pretrain_human_only: true` flag was not honored. Bot games made up **41% of raw game count** at `source_weight=1.0`. Per-position Elo-band weights also not applied. **v6 anchor numbers tainted** — Q41 51% parity and Q52 24% vs SealBot trained against bootstrap that learned partly from bot-style play. Phase 4.0/Phase B' diagnostics (§141-§144) inherit caveat. **Decision: rebuild v7 from scratch with `make corpus.export.pretrain`**. Preserve v6 as `bootstrap_corpus_v6.npz`/`bootstrap_model_v6.pt`. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§147_*.md`.

### §148 — Corpus rebuild: v7 human-only Elo-weighted — 2026-05-03
**Elo-weight bug fix in `scripts/export_corpus_npz.py`:** when `--max-positions` omitted (uncapped), `rng.choice(n, n, replace=False, p=w)` degenerates to permutation — per-position Elo weight had no effect on which positions kept; `weights_out = np.ones(...)` made `WeightedRandomSampler` sample uniformly. Patched: when uncapped, save per-position `source_weight × elo_band_weight / game_length` as `weights_out`. v7 corpus: 6,259 human games (≥15 plies decisive), 355,271 qualifying positions, 353,091 sampled, 2,435 MB, fp16 `(N,8,19,19)`. Elo bands: sub_1000=81,985 (w=0.5), 1000_1200=202,111 (w=1.0), 1200_1400=69,739 (w=1.5), 1400+=1,436 (w=2.0). v7 retrain (15 ep, batch 256, ~97 min on 3070): final loss 3.31, val_acc 0.75, 100/100 vs RandomBot. **SealBot n=200**: v7 16% vs v6 11% (z=1.46, p=0.14 n.s.); H2H 49%; threat C1 +0.00 (corpus-shift artifact) but C2 45% / C3 75% PASS. **Promoted**. HF push `timmyburn/hexo-bootstrap-{corpus,models}` versioned + canonical. Forensics: `reports/corpus_v7/promotion.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§148_*.md`.

### §149 — v7 verification + v7e30 fine-tune promotes — 2026-05-03
Pretrain saturation audit on v7 found last-3-epoch cumulative Δ = 1.6% of total descent — fails strict <1% gate (cosine LR reached eta_min, idled). Patched `pretrain.py`: `--resume`, `--lr-peak`, `--inference-out` flags. **v7e30 fine-tune**: resumed `pretrain_00000000.pt`, fresh cosine peak `5e-4 → 1e-5` for 15 more epochs; final loss 3.246. **SealBot n=500**: v6 11.4%, v7 13.2%, v7e30 **16.4%** (z=2.29 vs v6, **p=0.022 significant**). Threat C2/C3 preserved through fine-tune; C1 still flat (corpus-shift + flatter v7-family distribution). Human-fixture C1 probe: v7 +0.06 vs v6 +0.51 (lower), but v7 C2 42% vs v6 25% (+17pp) — flatter policy with preserved/improved top-K ranking. **v7e30 promoted to canonical**. Hygiene: `make train.fresh` wipes `replay_buffer.bin`; `buffer_state_at_corpus_load` event; Q41 BLOCK threshold 43% → 38%. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§149_*.md`.

### §150 — v7full: 30-epoch full retrain promotes — 2026-05-03
**Canonical bootstrap anchor.** User ran full retrain on vast.ai 5080: single-cycle cosine 30 epochs, peak `2e-3`, **`eta_min=5e-5`** (raised from `1e-5`). Wall ~83 min. Final loss **3.1573** (vs v7e30 3.2462, Δ -0.089). `--eta-min` flag added (`1f822ae`). **SealBot n=500: 87/500 = 17.4% [14.3%, 21.0%]** (z=2.70 vs v6, **p=0.007 significant**; vs v7e30 z=0.42 p=0.67 n.s. but every metric directional + v6-anchor edge becomes significant). Threat: C1 +0.20 (partial recovery from v7e30 0.0 toward v6 0.6); C2 50% / C3 70% **PASS**. Colony wins 12/87 = 13.8% (line baseline). Promoted; canonical `bootstrap_model.pt` = v7full sha `29306533…`. **Recipe locked**: 30 ep cosine, peak `2e-3`, `eta_min=5e-5`. Forensics: `reports/corpus_v7/threat_probe_v7full.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§150_*.md`.

### §152 — Phase B' instrumented smoke: Class-4 dominant — 2026-05-04
Run `w4c_smoke_v6_instrumented_5080` aborted at step 2560/5000 after four-class signal saturated. **Verdict matrix**: Class 4 (q-axis stride-5 distance-5 spam) DOMINANT, ρ(stride5_run, is_ply_cap) = +0.50, p = 5e-42; Class 3 (buffer composition) STRONGLY ACTIVE downstream; Class 2 (value-head drift) ACTIVE downstream (dec=−0.69±0.03); Class 1 (stale dispatch) NOT TESTED (eval_interval=5000 zeroed model_version). **Causal story**: v7full mildly prefers stride-5 east-west extensions; smoke γ knobs + Dirichlet + playout_cap full=0.5 sims=600 + cosine temp amplify into dominant policy mode (cap_max median 30 vs T2 baseline 3 = 10×). 87% cap-rate → 98% draw-coded buffer → value head trains to overshoot draw_value to −0.69 → reinforces cap-prone policy. **Pattern**: mixed-color stones along single hex row at distance-5 spacing (`x____o____o____x_`). Persists despite §130 rotation (per-game uniform across dihedral group). Existing macros miss it: `colony_extension_fraction` gates at hex_dist > 6; `axis_distribution` measures distance-1 adjacency. v8 priority order written. Forensics: `reports/phase_b_prime/instrumented/diagnosis.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§152_*.md`.

### §154 — v9 hex-trunk turn FALSIFIED — 2026-05-05 (FALSIFIED ROW: Falsified Hypotheses Register §154)
HexConv2d + corner_mask + per-move rotation cadence on `phase_b_prime_v9_hex_native`. Probe gates PASS but selfplay drops to 0-1% SealBot WR. **Mechanism**: probes cannot validate dynamic equivariance — only MCTS-matched eval can. Class-5 eval-gate guard (colony-attractor on wr_best) now v10 priority 1. Branch retained as architecture-research substrate (knobs default off; production paths unaffected). Memory: `project_phase_b_prime_v9_falsified.md`.

### §155 / §156 / §157 — Cosine-temperature draw-collapse arc — 2026-05-05 → 2026-05-06 [MERGE]
**L3, L9 origin.** §155 T1 ran R0-R5 knob-isolation harness (`scripts/v7full_training_knob_isolation.py`) ruling out Dirichlet / cosine-temp / opening_plies / parallelism alone (all ≤ 5.5% draws). T1.1 ran R6-R10 MCTS-side: only **R10 (full conjunction)** hit 91.0% [86.2%, 94.2%] draws under frozen v7full **without training updates** — proximate cause is super-additive interaction of smoke MCTS regime + exploration knobs. FALSIFIED by §156. T2 bootstrap-floor multi-anchor gate landed default-off (`bootstrap_anchor` opponent + `bootstrap_floor.min_winrate=0.45` AND-combined with `wr_best ≥ 0.55`).

**§156 R11-R14 bisection (each removes one knob from R10):**
| Variant | Knob removed | draws | draw_rate |
|---|---|---:|---|
| R10 | (full smoke regime) | 182/200 | 91.0% |
| R11 | Dirichlet ε=0.10 → 0 | 176/200 | 88.0% NULL |
| **R12** | **cosine temp → fixed τ=0.5** | **10/200** | **5.0% LOAD-BEARING** |
| R13 | opening_plies 1 → 4 | 170/200 | 85.0% NULL |
| R14 | playout cap → uniform 600 | 198/200 | 99.0% INVERSELY load-bearing |

**Load-bearing knob = cosine temperature schedule.** Fix: `temperature_threshold_compound_moves: 0` + `temp_min: 0.5`. Mandatory pairings: `legal_move_radius_jitter: true` (R12 colony rate 67% mitigation), `bootstrap_floor.enabled: true min_winrate: 0.45`. R12 colony rate = 67% is the §147 v5 / §154 v9 colony attractor — jitter holds it at trace levels.

**§157 5k validation on 5080 (commits 9412a38, 83be4d7, f2e4555):** wall 3h 18m, draw_rate 7.5% last-200, stride5 P90=4, row_max P90=13, colony_ext_frac max 0.086, 0 NaN. **SealBot offline eval n=200 final-ckpt: 19.0% (38/200)** — beats 17% gate, matches §150 v7full 17.4% within sample noise (Δ +1.6pp). wr_anchor 0.28 → 0.42 → 0.37 (bootstrap-floor refused all sub-floor promotions correctly). **Operator decisions (Gate 6):** Path B selected (skip 40k sustained, pivot to encoding migration); `legal_move_radius_jitter: true` propagated to top-level; bootstrap-floor default-on + frozen v7full path; cosine-temp NOT propagated (variant-pinned).

**§157 follow-ups:** #1 `eval_interval` must be ≥ 2500 (smoke eval cadence at 500 produced 6 skipped events; only 3/10 fired); #2 stride5/row_max dashboard-only on master; #3 final eval skipped on `--iterations` exit; #4 `sealbot_colony_bug_risk` legacy guard; #5 draw_rate is NOT abort signal (user verdict: draws are model missing open-4s, not pathology).

## §158–§163 — Hygiene + Refactor waves — 2026-05-06 [MERGE]

**Hygiene wave (§158, §158a, §158b):** L3 variant-config cleanup. §158 retired 6 superseded variants (`smoke_A/B`, `w4c_smoke_v6_*` family) + 3 stale docs. §158a coordinated wave: `phase118_recovery.yaml` + dead `dry_run_batch.py`; `calib_R1-R4.yaml` + `run_calibration_run.sh` + Makefile target; `sweep_*ch.yaml` + Phase-1 harness (`run_sweep.py`, `tournament_sweep.py`); `baseline_puct.yaml` + coordinated references. 924 py pass post-wave. §158b L8 Stage 3 disk reclaim: ~9 GB freed (workspace 48 → 39 GB); cumulative L8 total ~58 GB.

**Refactor wave (§159, §159a, §160, §160a, §161, §162, §163):** Audit-driven structural splits, all FF-merged to master.
- **§159**: `hexo_rl/training/loop.py` 1464 → 686 LOC (-53%). Five new modules: `anchor.py` (anchor I/O), `signals.py` (signal handlers), `orchestrator.py` (training hooks), `lifecycle.py` (subsystem builders), `eval/pipeline_setup.py`. 8 commits + sprint log.
- **§159a**: StepCoordinator extraction. `loop.py` 686 → 357 (-48%); new `step_coordinator.py` 893 LOC (closure → class; 18 per-step decisions O2-O6/D0-D10 preserve identical ordering DAG). +20 behavioural tests. Constraints R1-R25 honored. 4 commits.
- **§160 / §160a**: `eval_pipeline.py` 529 → 472. New `gate_logic.py` (GateConfig + `evaluate_gate` + ci_confidence wired via `norm.ppf`), `reporting.py`. **2 of 4 audit claims stale** (BT + SQLite already extracted pre-§160). §160a: `_load_anchor_model` prefix-strip dedup'd to `normalize_model_state_dict_keys` (inherits BN-key + 18-plane guards).
- **§161**: Q-§159b §B item 15 lifecycle.py coverage (+5 tests for build_subsystems, resolve_anchor branches, teardown).

Pure-move (subagent audit verified). **Audit row PARTIALLY STALE**: 6 of 8 listed concerns already in `selection.rs`/`backup.rs` pre-§163. Bench gate PASS.

## §164–§174 — Encoding migration arc (KEEP-DISTILLED)

### §164 — Phase 5+ entry probe wave: P1 anchor / P2 perception (CATASTROPHIC) / P3 corner-mask — 2026-05-07
Three probes dispatched in parallel; nothing landed on master.
- **P1 (Principled — memory misread).** Live self-play forwards all K cluster views to NN, min-pools value, scatter-max policy. Replay buffer push emits one row per cluster per ply. Index-0 picks exist only in `pretrain.py:564,568` (Aug-only RandomBot validation) + `early_game_probe.py:103` (Aug-only monitoring fixture). Bootstrap corpus picks **first cluster covering played move**, not index 0 — Principled by design.
- **P2 (CATASTROPHIC).** Rule: r=8 placement (hexo v0.2.0); our perception: r=5. **Bot WR 78% vs `far_line` (scripted r=6-8 6-axis adversary)** with 22% opp colony reach-6; brain-dead script outperforms strongest engine's 17.4% empirical edge vs SealBot. Mechanism: stones at hex_dist 6-8 from any bot stone form their **own cluster** (`CLUSTER_THRESHOLD=5`) with their own window; policy treats them as low-priority. **Deployment hotfix REQUIRED before hexo.did.science deploy.** Three options: (a) bump constants to 8 (re-opens fragmentation), **(b) hybrid r=5 selfplay + r=8 inference (PREFERRED short-term)**, (c) 25×25 window (large scope; encoding migration). PyO3 bindings for `set_legal_move_radius` + `set_cluster_threshold` missing.
- **P3 (Neutral within noise).** Corner-mask (hex_dist ≤ 9, 271 cells survive of 361) bench A/B on 5080: aug −8.12%, worker +20% (borderline noise). Smoke OFF vs ON last-100: draws 11% → 7%, X/O/draw 52/37/11 → 47/46/7 (better balance), colony_extension_fraction max 0.030 → 0.0. **SealBot Δ = −2.5pp NOT statistically significant**. Mask safe to ship. **D3 verdict: adopt inscribed hex** on §152 dihedral-symmetry argument.

### §165 — v8 encoding migration design + spike wave — 2026-05-07
Three parallel spike subagents. **S1 bbox crop**: fixed-max single-tensor bbox-of-all-stones at HALF=16, BBOX_SIDE=33, m=8, 9-11 planes, K-aggregation REMOVED, N_ACTIONS=1090. **S2 KataGo GPool**: 2 sites at `{6,10}` (50%/83% of 12-block trunk), `KataConvAndGPool` operator verbatim, `c_main=128, c_mid=128, c_gpool=32`. Trunk FLOPs DECREASE 2.1% at 19×19. SE × GPool compose cleanly. Policy + opp_reply FC → KataGo 1×1 conv + linear_pass = **−482k params (FREE WIN)**. **S3 v8 corpus regen + cutover plan**: ~10-15 min corpus + ~3 hr retrain = 3.25 hr wall on 5080. Raw human JSONs persisted; no re-scrape needed. **Final v8 spec Path β**: 25×25 + 11 planes + R=8 + 96-channel trunk + GPool {6,10} + KataGo policy head + N_ACTIONS=625 (no pass). Phase A-E sequence: short-lived branches off master, FF-merge on bench-gate PASS. Forensics: `audit/encoding_spikes/{s1,s2,s3,SPIKE_SUMMARY}.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§165_*.md`.

### §166 — Phase A: encoding pipeline core (gated coexistence) — 2026-05-07
Operator-revised strategy: NOT hard cutover. v8 lands as **gated coexistence**: v6 path canonical default + byte-exact; v8 path opt-in via `configs/model.yaml encoding.version: v8`. Preserves rollback envelope, unblocks Phase B without putting v6 at risk. **4 Phase A commits + 1 contract** on `encoding/phase_a_pipeline`:
- Bucket C (`ad8dd10`): `EncodingSpec` NamedTuple + `resolve_encoding(config)` in `hexo_rl/utils/encoding.py`; v8 constants in `constants.py` (BOARD_SIZE_V8=25, NUM_CELLS_V8=625, BUFFER_CHANNELS_V8=11, N_ACTIONS_V8=625, LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS_V8=8, MARGIN_M_V8=8); `configs/model.yaml` encoding section default v6.
- Bucket A (`ee2de0b`): Rust `sym_tables.rs` shape-parameterized; v8 const symbols (STATE_STRIDE_V8=6875, CHAIN_STRIDE_V8=3750, POLICY_STRIDE_V8=625, AUX_STRIDE_V8=625, HALF_V8=12); `SymTables::with_shape(board_size, n_planes)`; `src_plane_lookup` `[[usize;N_PLANES];N_SYMS]` → `Vec<Vec<usize>>`; `apply_symmetry_state` / `apply_chain_symmetry` read `n_cells` from `sym_tables.n_cells`.
- Bucket B (`66b9f9c`): `hexo_rl/bootstrap/dataset_v8.py` (replay_game_to_triples_v8, encode_position_v8, bbox-of-all-stones centroid integer-truncation + n_clipped telemetry); `_compute_chain_planes` shape-derived; `get_policy_scatters(board_size=25, has_pass=False)`; `--encoding v6/v8` flag on `export_corpus_npz.py`.
- Bucket D (`b47136c`): **P2 hotfix-(c) bundled** — `Board.set_legal_move_radius(r)` + `legal_move_radius()` PyO3 bindings; dataset_v8 replay Board uses R=8.

**Tests**: 1028 py + 151 Rust lib + 6 Rust integration GREEN (41 net new: 9 resolver + 8 v8 sym + 28 dataset_v8 inc. 4 P2). v6 999 py + 143 Rust unchanged → byte-exact regression guard satisfied. **Bench gate** (n=5 post-Phase-A laptop): 8/10 PASS, 2 WATCH (`buffer_push_per_s` -7.7%, `worker_pos_per_hr` -6.2%); n=5 close-out confirmed both as boost-clock variance noise (§102). 5080 baseline for Phase B captured. Forensics: `reports/encoding_phase_a/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§166_*.md`.

### §167 — Phase B v8 variant exploration sprint — 2026-05-07 → 2026-05-08
5-arm matrix on `encoding/phase_b_variants`:

| Arm | Channels | Depth | GPool sites | Head GPool | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B0 | 128 | 12 | none | no | Control (encoding-shape change only) |
| **B1** | **128** | **12** | **{6,10}** | **yes** | **Primary candidate** |
| B2 | 96 | 12 | {6,10} | yes | Capacity probe (Path β shrink) |
| B3 | 128 | 10 | {5,8} | yes | Depth probe |
| B4 | 160 | 12 | {6,10} | yes | Width probe |

**B1 NaN incident**: 2026-05-07 14:19 retrain hit single-batch fp16 overflow at step -22000 (epoch 14 of 30) in `KataConvAndGPool.linear_g` (3·c_gpool=96 → c_out=128). Standard PyTorch GradScaler chain didn't skip the step — `clip_grad_norm_(NaN, max=1.0)` computed `norm=NaN`, NaN clip_coef, optimizer wrote NaN. **Patch (`4c7dbb5`)**: `if not torch.isfinite(loss): continue` before backward (defense-in-depth, single CPU `isfinite` check, no perf hit). B1 retry: ~24% steps NaN-skipped, final loss 3.227 (best clean). B4 OOM'd at batch=256; fallback batch=128 ran ~80% NaN-skipped (only ~6 epochs effective).

**SealBot WR (argmax-only, n=200, t=0.5): ALL 5 v8 arms = 0/200 = 0%** [0%, 1.9%]. v7full v6-argmax baseline: r=5 6.5% / r=8 12.5% / r=10 15%. B1 across radii r=8/10/12: 0%/0%/0%. **The v8 0% is NOT v8-architecture falsification** — structural limitation of argmax-only cross-encoding eval. K-cluster's inference-time multi-window pooling acts like a tiny "ensemble" that bbox lacks. Both effects vanish under MCTS (Phase D §168). **Canonical pick: B1** (best clean loss 3.227). Threat probe deferred (v6-only fixture). bbox clip rate ~6%/stone (above S1's 1% Path α trigger) — Path α escalation deferred. **v7full radius curve 6.5% → 12.5% → 15% confirms cross-encoding gap real**; memory `feedback_v6_v8_same_training_data.md` (corpora share 6,259 raw games — encoding changes density only) + `project_v8_argmax_handicap.md`. Forensics: `reports/encoding_phase_b/VARIANT_SUMMARY.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§167_*.md`.

### §168 — Eval harness generalization + v6w25 plumbing (Phase D restructured) — 2026-05-08
Branch `encoding/eval_generalization`. **Eval harness generalized along (encoding × inference method) axes** — single invocation handles any `(checkpoint, method)` tuple.

**Architectural decisions locked:**
- `checkpoint_loader.load_model_with_encoding(path, device)` auto-detects encoding from state-dict (in_channels=11 → v8; =8 + filename "v6w25" → v6w25; =8 default → v6); returns `(model, EncodingSpec, label)`.
- `build_inference_method(name, model, device, label)` dispatches V6/V8 Argmax/MCTS/Fast bots per `(encoding, method)` tuple.
- `V8MCTSBot` — sequential PUCT in Python; Rust `MCTSTree` is v6-locked.
- **v6w25 = runtime parameterization** (NOT cargo features per §166 contract §4.3): `Board.set_cluster_threshold(8)` + `set_cluster_window_size(25)`. v6 and v6w25 cluster encoders coexist in one binary.
- `scripts/run_sealbot_eval.py` (renamed from `eval_v8_vs_sealbot.py`).

**v6w25 artifacts (5080):**
- Corpus: 319,207 positions, 3.8 GB, sha256 `85c045934c90…`.
- Bootstrap: 21 MB, sha256 `571a82f844fc…`, pretrain 1h 33m.

**v6w25 sanity SealBot argmax @ r=8 n=200: 14.5% [10.3%, 20.0%]** (29/200, 2 draws, mean ply 51.5). v7full @ r=8 baseline = 12.5% [8.6%, 17.8%] (§167). CIs overlap — cluster-threshold widening (5→8) does NOT materially help argmax-only WR.

**Commits**: `3f2bf10` (eval harness), `ed440a3` (Rust v6w25 constants), `0c62138` (pretrain + HexTacToeNet wiring). 1085 py + 151 Rust unit + 6 Rust integration PASS. T3 matched-MCTS comparison deferred to §169. Forensics: `reports/sprint_archive/§168_eval-harness-v6w25-plumbing.md`.

### §169 — Four-way encoder ablation (A1/A2/A3/A4 + §169a probe) [MERGE] — 2026-05-08
Branch `encoding/four_way_ablation`. Closes the bbox-vs-K-cluster question.

**Verdict matrix:**

| arm | loss | argmax @ r=8 (n=200) | MCTS-128 (n=200) | params (M) | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1 K-cluster + min/max (v6w25 anchor)** | 3.57 | **14.5%** | 25% (§169 P1 sanity MCTS-32 n=20) | 5.29 | **CANONICAL** |
| A2 K-cluster + PMA pool | 4.25 | 4.5% | 3.5% | 6.30 | NEGATIVE — K=1-pretrain regime; SAB sees single token per batch |
| A3 K-cluster + PMA + global token | 3.62 | 7.5% | 2.5% | 6.37 | PARTIAL POSITIVE — global gate climbed 0.10 → 0.66 (6.6×); closes 95% of loss gap, halves argmax gap, no MCTS lift |
| A4 bbox + canvas_realness + PartialConv2d | **3.47** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | 3.85 | NEGATIVE — bbox direction STRUCTURAL, not padding semantics |

**Key mechanism (L4 origin):** **The encoding decides; the pool variant tweaks.** Training loss alone NOT sufficient signal — A4 has lowest loss but zero WR; A2 has highest loss but still beats A4 at argmax. Three candidate mechanisms for bbox failure: K-aggregation as cross-cluster contrast (K=1-pretrain forfeits multi-window inference); bbox-centroid frame instability (centroid moves up to m=8 cells per move); R=8 perception expansion (8× more action geometry per state). Per-cluster bbox at CLUSTER_THRESHOLD=8 falling back to unified bbox specced in `audit/encoding_spikes/s1_bbox_algorithm.md` §5.2; operator's call for §170 follow-up.

**§169a A4 spatial-pathway-deadness probe.** Pre-registered: E1 dead `mean(KL_S) < 0.10 AND KL_S/KL_R < 0.05`; E2 alive `mean(KL_S) > 1.00 OR KL_S/KL_R > 0.30`. **Results**: KL_S = 1.533 > 1.0 → **E2 PASS spatial path alive**. argmax visits 133/200 distinct cells. Ratio KL_S/KL_R = 0.273 → scalar-dominated but not scalar-only. PartialConv2d + canvas_realness propagate spatial signal correctly through trunk + KataGo policy head. User's "spatial-dead" hypothesis FALSIFIED. Surfaces alternatives: distribution-shift fine-tune (§171 A4 P2-reopen), cross-encoding eval gap audit, scalar-ablation follow-up (§170 P0).

**PMA-collapse smoke** flagged on A3 fixture as probe artifact (synthetic 2-cluster fixture trained model has strong absolute-position preference; gate=0.66 + non-zero argmax delta on real games prove healthy use). Threat probes all SKIPPED (v6w25 fixture gap; §170 follow-up).

Commits: pool registry + wire `pool_type='pma'` + retrain config + A2 eval; A3 global encoder + crop helper + pretrain + eval; A4 canvas_realness + PartialConv2d + retrain + eval; §169a probe.

### §170 — gpool-bias retrain wave + Gate 6 operator surface [MERGE] — 2026-05-08 → 2026-05-09
Six sub-passes (P0–P4 P2). Closes the v6w25 inference-side question.

**Verdict matrix:**

| Pass | Arm | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | A4 scalar-ablation probe | SPATIAL_RICH (KL_zeroed=4.19 ≫ 1.50) | NULL — falsifies SCALAR_DOMINATED; argmax stable 0/200 |
| P1 | A3 MCTS-N curve (PMA-value-semantics) | flat MCTS-32/64/128 = 2.5% | NULL — Cochran-Armitage p=0.0277 entirely from argmax vs any-MCTS split |
| P3 | A1 + gpool-bias on both heads | NULL on value head | NULL |
| **P4 P1** | **A1 + gpool-bias-policy-only retrain** | **22% argmax SealBot @ r=8 n=200** | **CANONICAL** |
| P4 P2 | Adversarial corpus prep for §171 A4 fine-tune | corpus assembled, fine-tune handoff | landed |

**Key mechanism:** **gpool-bias-policy-only (P4 P1)** is the load-bearing intervention. Full gpool-bias on both heads (P3) is NULL on value. Earlier attribution of 22% to A4 fine-tune was wrong — A4 was already 0%; the lift is from policy-side gpool-bias applied on A1 K-cluster.

**Canonical pins:**
- **v6w25 = canonical for pretrain + eval + matched-MCTS** (P4 P1 mechanism).
- **v7full = canonical for self-play** pending α (§173) implementation.

**Gate 6 operator surface:** `scripts/run_gate6_eval.py` — A1+gpool-bias matched-MCTS at n=200, 5080. CLI: `--bootstrap`, `--encoding`, `--inference`, `--n-games`.

Forensics: `reports/gpool_bias/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§170_gpool-bias-retrain-wave.md`. Branch `encoding/four_way_ablation` retired after canonical pin. Memory: `project_170_p3_falsified.md`.

### §171 — Sprint scoping + blocked handoff + §171 A4 P2-reopen (DEAD) — 2026-05-09 → 2026-05-11
Branch `phase4/p171_selfplay_smoke`. P0 corpus-sha manifest transposition corrected (`bootstrap_corpus_v8.npz` is vanilla v8 sha `adb88412…`; canvas_realness variant is `bootstrap_corpus_v8_canvas_realness.npz` sha `110ea6b2…`). **P3 BLOCKED** by two-layer issue: Layer 1 canvas vs trunk `board_size` semantics inconsistency (A2.1 trainer trunk=25 vs A2.2 pool guard canvas=19); **Layer 2 load-bearing**: `Board::to_planes()` hardcoded 18×19×19 regardless of `cluster_window_size` — selfplay's `state.to_tensor()` calls single-window path; v6w25 pretrain worked because `dataset_v6w25.py` uses `get_cluster_views()`. v6w25 sustained selfplay requires **α multi-window** (§173). Recommendation: Option α structural fix in §172.

**Pin scope (§171 P3.6):** v6w25 canonical for pretrain+eval+matched-MCTS; v7full canonical for selfplay pending α; α = Phase 4.5+ scope.

**§171 A4 P2-reopen C (DEAD).** 2026-05-11. Distribution-shift fine-tune side-arm on `phase4/encoding_registry`. Pre-registered: E1 ALIVE `MCTS-64 > 8% AND CI_LB > 5%`; E2 DEAD `MCTS-64 ≤ 2% AND CI_UB < 4%`. Recipe: resume `A4_canvas_realness.pt`, mixed corpus 95% bootstrap + 5% adversarial via `WeightedRandomSampler`, 3000 steps, peak LR 5e-5/eta_min 5e-6, freeze input_conv + tower[0..7], trainable tower[8..11] + heads (35.2%). **Result: MCTS-64 0/200 Wilson95 [0.000%, 1.88%] — DEAD cleanly met.** §169 P0 SPATIAL_RICH framing FALSIFIED for frozen-spine class. Closes bbox+canvas_realness+frozen-spine line. **Correction**: original close-out claimed "22% → 0% argmax collapse"; the 22% was misattributed (§170 P3 A1+gpool-bias, not A4 baseline). A4 was already 0% pre-fine-tune (`reports/ablation_169/A4_eval.json`); fine-tune did not damage anything new. DEAD verdict rests strictly on MCTS-64 axis. Forensics: `reports/sprint_171_a4/`, `reports/sprint_archive/§171_sprint-scoping-blocked-handoff.md`. Memory: `project_171_a4_p2_reopen_c_dead.md`, `project_bootstrap_argmax_drift_check_20260511.md`.

### §172 — Encoding Registry Single-Source-of-Truth + Phase B v7full sustained — 2026-05-09 → 2026-05-11
Branch `phase4/encoding_registry`. **Trigger**: §171 P3 plane-export blocker — `Board::to_planes` hardcoded `BOARD_SIZE=19` even when `Board::with_encoding(v6w25_spec)` set `cluster_window_size=25` → silent shape corruption. Root cause: scattered encoding state across 23 surfaces.

**Phase A (A1–A10):** TOML at `engine/src/encoding/registry.toml` as canonical single source. Lazy `&'static` lookup. `RegistrySpec` Rust + `hexo_rl.encoding` Python module. New encoding adds 1 TOML entry; `python -m hexo_rl.encoding audit` verifies parity. Variant configs use `encoding: <name>` only; scattered overrides rejected at load. Threaded through Rust hot path / Python selfplay / training+scripts / model+eval / configs.

**A10 close-out (13 commits f687602..576f69d):** §10 amended consistency-not-equality; §11.6 cross-table consistency (6 INVs joined on corpus_sha256); 3 **HIGH-RISK silent-corruption hazards** retired:
1. `engine/src/game_runner/mod.rs:159` `SelfPlayRunner::new` pyo3 default kwarg silent v6 fallback (feature_len=8*19*19, policy_len=19*19+1) → now derives from `spec.state_stride()`/`spec.policy_stride()`.
2. `engine/src/inference_bridge.rs:295` `InferenceBatcher::new` same pattern; `encoding_spec` kwarg added.
3. `engine/src/replay_buffer/sym_tables.rs:26` `N_ACTIONS=362` audit confirmed all consumers v6-only; v8 pinned to `spec.policy_stride()=625`.

A6 round-trip test (5 encodings PASS); A7 α design doc (`docs/designs/encoding_alpha_multiwindow_selfplay_design.md`); A8 docs cleanup (README + CLAUDE.md + docs tree); A9 three parallel review subagents PASS. 1306 py + 223 rs pass.

**Phase B (v7full sustained, B1-redo + B2):** B1 first launch surfaced G1 (`bootstrap_anchor` strict-load failure on `tower.*` ↔ `trunk.tower.*` aliases) + G2 (92.3% draw rate inherited cosine). B1-redo `sprint_172_p3_v7full_r12.yaml` + `cf73390`: R12 cosine disable + `_load_anchor_model` migrated to `load_model_with_encoding` delegate. 1200-step smoke PASS — draw_rate 0.923 → 0.040 (23×), colony_extension_fraction = 0.0, bootstrap_anchor LOADED.

**B2 30K sustained on 5080** (commit `e90e49d` mid-run wired `argmax_n` DRIFT detector + `eval_interval` 1000 → 5000; `--iterations` is LR-schedule denominator NOT step-stop — ran 3024 over). Only step-20K promoted (best_arena 0.610 CI_LB 0.512). **sealbot STALLED at 0.05 four consecutive rounds (15K/20K/25K/30K)** vs §150 anchor 17.4% n=500 — 12.4pp short on point estimate. bootstrap_anchor oscillating 0.50-0.65; best_arena post-promotion parity 0.55-0.56; argmax_n DRIFT detector inert (0/20 across all 6 rounds); colony_fraction 0.0 throughout.

**B verdict — no v7full graduation.** Self-play distribution overfit: single-window v7full selfplay generates positions model learns to play well vs self but doesn't exercise threat structures SealBot exploits at r=8. **Encoder-specific gap, not value-drift pathology** (argmax_n DRIFT 0/20). Transfer gap is structural at the encoder level, not head-recalibration. **Forward: §173 α multi-window K-cluster selfplay.**

**Gate 6 decision packet (operator):** (a) Do NOT promote v7full P3 ckpt (save step-20K as B3 anchor candidate); (b) YES open §173 α implementation; (c) δ A4 DEAD verdict closes bbox+canvas_realness+frozen-spine; (d/e) merge `phase4/encoding_registry` → master directly with `sprint-172-close` tag; (f) no new architectural reopens.

### §173 — α multi-window K-cluster selfplay implementation — 2026-05-11
Branch `phase4.5/m173_alpha_multiwindow`. **Scope corrected** from §172 A7 design (buffer+trainer parameterization) to **constants-parameterization only** — no changes to worker_loop architecture (L319-411 dispatch, L662-694 K-fanned push). Retire every v6 hardcoded literal in replay-buffer + game-runner hot paths, replacing with `RegistrySpec`-derived reads.

**Commits (10, A3 → A8'' + A7 merge):**
- `68934a5` A3: `kept_plane_indices` + `n_source_planes` TOML; Python `n_cells` parity bug fix (was `board_size²`, now `trunk_size²`).
- `38b0544` A4: spec-wire strides + `sym_tables_for()` + H5 pass-slot guard.
- `5928f9d` A5a: spec-wire strides in worker_loop + mod.rs.
- `3a11d71` A5b: `aggregate_policy*` spec-threading (initial -10.47% worker_pos_per_hr regression from RegistrySpec by value — see L16; recovered to +6.01% via scalar-API + `#[inline]`).
- `7f43fdc` A6: Python triple-setter migration (`with_encoding_name`); setter guards raise when encoding is set.
- `00a25f2` A7: audit CLI regex tighten + allowlist gap closure.
- `8fd28e5` A8: cold-smoke variant + v6w25 baseline JSON + microsmoke tests.
- `2af7d99` A8': lift α multi-window guard in `pool.py` + trunk_size geometry refactor.
- `aedbb2a` A8'': spec-thread aux + `window_flat_idx` via `spec.n_cells()`.

**HAZARD closure** (H1-α through H6-α all CLOSED): sym_tables shape mismatch, rotate_aux ownership corruption, view truncation, aggregate_policy 626 vs 362 vector, sample.rs:220 pass-slot OOB, mod.rs:342 STATE_STRIDE v6. **H7-α (HEXB v7 encoding header field)** CARRIED to §174.

**Bench gate (n=5, post-A5b v2 vs pre-α):** all 10 targets PASS. MCTS −0.4%, NN inference −0.9%, NN latency −0.9%, buffer_push +3.1%, buffer_aug +1.2%, GPU util flat, worker_pos_per_hr +28.9% (within variance — methodology shift: pre-α 3s warmup vs post-A5b 90s).

**Phase B verdict:** A8 cold smoke (5K-step v6w25 sustained) DEFERRED — operator did not authorize 5080 launch before A10 close-out. Equivalent empirical signal: A8' microsmoke PASS (shapes 8×25×25/6×25×25/626, zero NaN/Inf); A8'' window_flat_idx green; post-A5b bench all PASS.

**G3/G4/G5 gating status:** G3 monotonic depth scaling UNVERIFIED; G4 value-head |max| ±50% band UNVERIFIED (baseline JSON `v6w25_baseline_value_max.json`: 0.308, band [0.154, 0.462]); G5 per-cluster variance drift ≤30% UNVERIFIED. §174 sustained must verify before any longer run.

**A9 review:** 3 parallel subagents PASS sprint-level. 4 SOFT-FAIL F1-F4 tagged for §174 (audit CLI strict-mode legacy literals; v8 `to_planes()` semantic mismatch pre-existing; G4/G5 empirically unverified pending smoke; MCTS architecture preserved as designed). No HARD-FAIL.

§174 prerequisites (BLOCKERS): (1) HEXB v7 format bump (encoding-name header field; H7-α carried); (2) A8 cold smoke G3/G4/G5 verification; (3) `n_source_planes` producer-side migration (deferred cleanup, non-blocking).

Locked §174 parameters (from P0): eval n=100 (sealbot/bootstrap_anchor/best_arena), eval_interval=5000, train:selfplay 2:1, buffer growth 500K @ step 250K, sustained bootstrap `bootstrap_model_v6w25.pt`, arena anchor static.

Forensics: `reports/sprint_173/`, `docs/designs/encoding_alpha_multiwindow_selfplay_design.md`, `reports/sprint_archive/§173_alpha-multiwindow-kcluster-selfplay.md`. Memory: `project_173_a3_a6_bundle_complete.md`, `feedback_registryspec_by_ref_in_hotpath.md`.

### §174 — v6w25 sustained: bootstrap investigation + escalation — CLOSED 2026-05-13
Branch `phase4.5/m176a_v7mw`. Three bootstrap recipes tested; none clears selfplay viability gate at R=8 MCTS-128.

| Bootstrap | SealBot MCTS-128 | Selfplay median plies | G4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30-epoch (canonical anchor) | **0% (0/200)** | 6 | PASS within band |
| e50 | 10% (10/100, artifact-suspect) | 6 | MARGINAL FAIL 0.489 |
| v6→v6w25 transfer FT | **0% (0/200)** | 8 | n/a |

**Timeline:**
1. First 30K run — FP16 GradScaler overflow on 25×25 geometry; LR 2e-3 → 1e-3 fix per §173 A8 v3 ablation.
2. Second 30K run — eval crash mid-pipeline (orthogonal; deferred).
3. e50 retrain (50 ep vs 30) hypothesis: more capacity-utilisation tightens heads → REGRESSED. Value head grew (0.489 vs band [0.154, 0.462]) — over-fits to corpus-mode signal selfplay cannot reproduce.
4. **Radius ablation FALSIFIED.** R∈{1..8} smokes off e30 bootstrap, otherwise identical. Median game length identical across all eight. Radius does NOT move bootstrap quality (smokes already R=8). `legal_move_radius_schedule` retained as downstream-training lever, not bootstrap-time hyperparameter.

**Root cause (`reports/s174_v6w25_investigation.md`):** Loss surface normal — v6w25 30-ep achieves 3.96 nats vs uniform (best of v6/v7full/v6w25); matches v7full value-loss trajectory. **Opening-fraction starvation H1 refuted:** ply ≤ 10 fraction 16.09% (v6w25) vs 17.15% (v6) — gap 1.06pp, not the multi-× predicted. Collapse is at **argmax-degeneracy / selfplay-interaction layer**, not corpus or loss. Transfer recipe inherited v6 trunk but lost opening knowledge in re-initialised policy FC.

**eval_random_opening_plies audit (Track 2):** §168 → §174 sealbot WR drop (14.5% → 0%) fully explained by `eval_random_opening_plies` 4 → 0 in `configs/eval.yaml:88`. With 4 random plies model got free positional diversity masking weaknesses; with 0 SealBot's preparation lands cleanly. No code fix — flip already in place.

**G-gates wired:** G3 `avg_game_length` in `iteration_complete` + per-game `game_length`. **G4 NEW THIS SPRINT** — `_g4_value_head_band_check` in every `run_evaluation` round; structlog WARNING on out-of-band; constants gate-internal. G5 `cluster_value_std_mean` + `cluster_policy_disagreement_mean` emitted in `iteration_complete` + `train_step_summary`.

**Infrastructure landed (Track 2):**
- Encoding auto-detect across `make pretrain` / `make eval` / `make selfplay.smoke` / `make transfer` — checkpoint metadata authoritative; CLI flag overrides on ambiguity.
- v6 → v6w25 transfer script (`scripts/transfer_v6_to_v6w25.py`).
- Makefile encoding-override knobs: `PRETRAIN_ENCODING`, `EVAL_ENCODING`, `SMOKE_ENCODING`, `TRANSFER_SOURCE`, `TRANSFER_OUTPUT`.
- vast.yaml audited clean: LR 1e-3, eval_interval 10000 (halved wall-time vs §173 P0; preserves stride math), random_opening_plies 0 on both paths.

**Forward: §175 v6 sustained.** Recipe: 100K steps, n=100 SealBot eval, matched cosine LR schedule inherited from §174 vast.yaml. Selfplay encoding v6 (single-window 19×19, existing path). v6w25 retained as future re-entry target once selfplay-friendly bootstrap recipe is found — current evidence says fix is at policy/value head + selfplay-interaction layer, NOT corpus layer.

**Retained baselines:**

| Name | Encoding | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `bootstrap_model.pt` (v6) | v6 | **§175 anchor** |
| `bootstrap_model_v7full.pt` | v7full | §150 anchor (17.4% n=500) |
| `bootstrap_model_v6w25.pt` (e30) | v6w25 | retained for analysis |
| `bootstrap_model_v6w25_e50.pt` | v6w25 | G4 marginal fail; dominated |
| `bootstrap_model_v6w25_transfer_ft.pt` | v6w25 | 0% MCTS-128; retained |

## §176 — Python codebase refactor cycle (2026-05-13 → 2026-05-14)

**Scope:** 80-proposal audit + 6-phase execute on `refactor/python-audit` branch.

**Phases:**
- Phase 0 — master plan fixup (`c4eaa53` CLAUDE.md scattered-keys clarification) + drift annotations (`838b5ed` open-questions log)
- Phase 1a/b — HEAD-blocker fixes (B2 `sweep_harness` restore, B1 `HexTacToeNet` encoding whitelist→registry)
- Phase 2 — invariant pre-flight tests (12 INV pins under `tests/refactor_invariants/`) + 4 low-risk additions
- Phase 3a — W1 deletions (-274 LOC net)
- Phase 3b — W1 extracts + SSR fixes + small renames (24 commits)
- Phase 4 — W2 splits + extracts (25 commits; 3 bench-gated items)
- Phase 5 — W3 cross-bucket consolidation (15 commits; 4 bench-gated items)

**Outcomes:**
- 86 commits landed `c4eaa53..HEAD` (post-rebase HEAD `7233d5d`); 171 files changed, +12102/-7446 (net +4656; dominated by P39 6-module pretrain split, P70 train.py orchestrator decomposition, and INV/fixture test scaffolding)
- 75 of 80 proposals landed (5 NEEDS-WORK resolved at Phase 0; 3 deferred to W3 sub-items)
- Cross-bucket SSR debt cleared: `utils/encoding.py` + `utils/constants.py` v6/v8 entries retired; ~37 callers migrated to §172 registry; `hexo_rl/bootstrap/bots/` retired (P78a–d) — all three SSR grep targets return 0 post-merge
- 12 behavior invariants pinned as regression tests under `tests/refactor_invariants/` (all green post-merge)
- HEAD-blocker B1 (v7-family pretrain crash via whitelist) + B2 (sweep_harness broken imports after §163 deletion) fixed
- Test count: 1518 → 1574 (+56 from new fixtures + INV pins). Single pre-existing failure `test_no_stale_plane_refs` baselined and unchanged
- Bench: all hot-path edits verified within ±5% on 10-metric gate (P3, P4, P8, P22, P24); cold-path skips documented per `docs/refactor-template.md`
- `make test.py` post-merge: 1574 passed / 1 failed (pre-existing) / 17 skipped / 4 deselected / 1 xpassed
- §175 selfplay state unaffected throughout — refactor branch strictly isolated; rebase onto `phase4.5/m176a_v7mw` HEAD `838b5ed` was conflict-free (no file overlap with in-flight commits)

**Deferred to future micro-refactor cycle** (tracked as `Q-§176-residual` in `06_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`):
- P24b/c: `HexTacToeNet.__init__` (262 LOC), `forward` (162 LOC), `aggregated_forward_K` (113 LOC) further decomposition — partial landed in Phase 5
- P70: `scripts.train::seed_everything` circular-import shim lifted inside orchestrator helper — clean candidate

Forensics: `reports/refactor_audit/00_MASTER_PLAN.md`, `reports/refactor_audit/p6_phase4.5_inflight_commits.txt`, Phase 5 reviewer verdict (in conversation history of `phase4.5/m176a_v7mw` § auditor session).

## §176 — Phase A — KrakenBot eval ladder validation + colony POC (2026-05-14)

Branch `phase4.5/s176_phase_a_validation`. Five-wave empirical investigation (A1–A4 parallel + B + C + D + E fresh-context review) closing **Q14 partial**, opening §176 Phase B implementation scope. §175 v6 sustained continues on vast; aborts at next eval boundary post-merge.

**Waves:**
- **A1** (`reports/s176_a1_kraken_smoke.md`) — submodule pinned `d9c5bfb`; verdict `INTEGRABLE_NOW` for MinimaxBot+RandomBot, `NEEDS_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD` for both MCTSBot variants (`vendor/bots/krakenbot/.gitignore:8`, no public mirror). MinimaxBot latency 222–232 ms @ time_limit∈{0.1,…,2.0}.
- **A2** (`reports/s176_a2_eval_arch.md`) — verdict `CACHING_CLEAN`. Evaluator loop stone-by-stone (evaluator.py:201-210); `_pending_move` cache already proven on SealBot+KrakenBot. Minimal-diff plan ~150-180 LOC, 0 INV pins fire.
- **A3** (`reports/s176_a3_selfplay_forensics.md`) — operator's "one large diffuse cluster" claim **REFUTED** by 21,371 §175 game records (vast run `c7e74d2842404a82bdd9f62edf740ea2`). Single-cluster fraction monotone-down 18.1% (20K) → 6.3% (50K); attractor is multi-island fragmentation. Step-change at 40K (n_components 9.61→13.77, +43%). **POC metric = `n_components` raw BFS, Cohen's d −0.822** (largest among 8 candidates). In-trainer `colony_extension_fraction` flat zero — does NOT capture §175 attractor; justifies new POC.
- **A4** (`reports/s176_a4_falsified_scan.md`) — 9 falsified rows + 11 mechanism lessons (L1–L17 subset) + 4 regressions + 4 open Qs. 15-item do-not list each empirically sourced. Surfaced 7 master-prompt gaps (pool freeze, e30/e50 pretrain, radius+cosine pairing, v6 corpus blacklist, extended smoke boundary, frozen-spine rejection, realistic plumbing budget).
- **B** (`reports/s176_b_smoke.md`) — `KrakenBotRandomBot` + `KrakenBotMCTSBot` skeleton + `scripts/tournament_validate.py` + 3 wrapper tests (PASS). 15-game smoke verdict `PROCEED-TO-C`. Flagged: `bootstrap_model.pt` is v6w25; `our_v6_*` Wave C must pin `bootstrap_model_v6.pt`.
- **C** (`reports/s176_c_tourney/summary.md`) — 1050-game round-robin / 7 bots / 50 games/pair / laptop wall 85 min. Mid-tourney critical fix: KrakenBot MinimaxBot returns `[(0,0)]` sentinel when `_generate_turns` rejects all compounds (vendor lines 184/219/325/330); naive uniform-random fallback caused 0.42 sentinel/game in mid-game (ply ≥20). Smart neighbour-2 fallback (`_smart_legal_fallback` in `hexo_rl/bots/krakenbot_bot.py`) using KrakenBot's own `_D2_OFFSETS` pool prevented 438 uniform-random degradations across full run (fb_n2=438 / fb_rand=0).
- **D** (`reports/s176_d_plan.md`) — §176 Phase B implementation plan, 6 commits ≤10 cap, ~990 LOC delta, zero bench gates (all cold paths).
- **E** (`reports/s176_e_review.md`) — fresh-context audit verdict **CLEAR** across all 5 dimensions. 7-row risk register; 3 non-blocking strengthening notes for S6.

**BT ladder (anchor=sealbot, n=50/pair):**

**V1–V6 verdicts** (full text + numbers in `reports/s176_c_tourney/summary.md`):

| ID | Hypothesis | Verdict | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | strongest Kraken MCTS > SealBot | `N/A_MCTSBOT_BLOCKED`; modified-V1 FAIL | strongest tested Kraken (MinimaxBot @ 1.0s) is −494 Elo vs sealbot |
| V2 | Kraken MinimaxBot @ 1.0s > MCTSBot | `N/A_MCTSBOT_BLOCKED`; side-finding: MinimaxBot @ 0.1s ≈ @ 1.0s (Δ −5 Elo within CI) | iterative-deepening saturates at depth 4 + sentinel-fallback rate inflates draws |
| V3 | MinimaxBot colony ≤ MCTSBot colony − 10pp | `N/A_MCTSBOT_BLOCKED`; modified-V3 PASS | sealbot 35.0% vs kraken_minimax_strong 7.1%, gap 27.9pp, CIs non-overlapping by 18pp |
| V4 | SealBot colony > all Kraken | FAIL (kraken_random 85.7% > sealbot 35.0%) | caveat: kraken_random only 7 wins, CI wide |
| V5 | our_v6 strictly between Random and weakest Kraken | FAIL — our_v6_mcts128 is the 2nd-strongest bot in the tourney, not a weak baseline | our_v6 −62 BT vs kraken_random −3072 / randombot −3091 |
| V6 | cross-pair colony ≠ self-pair (opponent-coupled) | PASS — sealbot colony ranges 0.000 (vs argmax) → 0.412 (vs kraken_minimax_strong), 41pp spread | colony emergence is opponent-driven, not bot-intrinsic |

**D1–D5 master-prompt decision verdicts:**

| ID | Verdict | Source |
|---|---|---|
| D1 BotProtocol caching not `get_turn` | BACKED | A2 CACHING_CLEAN + Wave C 1050-game stability |
| D2 tourney includes all Kraken variants | PARTIAL — MCTSBot blocked, defer to §177+ until weights | A1 NEEDS_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD |
| D3 MinimaxBot colony < MCTSBot colony | PARTIAL — modified BACKED (vs SealBot 27.9pp); MCTSBot blocked | V3 PASS |
| D4 mix 75/15/10 | NEEDS_REVISION → adjusted bot pool: sealbot 50% / our_v6 30% / kraken_strong 15% / kraken_random 5% (Elo-derived per-source weights) | Wave C BT ladder |
| D5 Source A first, Source B target | BACKED | V6 opponent-coupled colony + A4 do-not #1 mandates subprocess for B |

**New mechanism lessons (L18+ candidates):**

- **L18** — *Pretrained-bootstrap-at-MCTS-128 can match an external minimax engine.* Wave C: our_v6 bootstrap (`bootstrap_model_v6.pt`, untrained on selfplay) is 25/50 H2H vs SealBot @ 0.5s, BT delta −62 (95% CI [−150, +26], WR Wilson95 [36.3%, 63.7%], n=50 — point-estimate-parity-consistent, not strongly-asserted parity). Implication: a "weak external opponent" framing for §175-style transfer-gap diagnoses is wrong at matched MCTS perception — the degradation is internal self-play head drift, not opponent-strength regression. **Refined by L22 below:** "head drift" is sampled-policy distribution flattening into colony attractor under T=0.5, not argmax-mode regression past bootstrap.
- **L19** — *KrakenBot MinimaxBot `_generate_turns` sentinel `[(0,0)]` is the upstream strength floor, not the time_limit.* time_limit ∈ {0.1, 1.0} produces BT delta −5 Elo. The 0.42 sentinel/game rate in mid-board positions (ply ≥20) caps strength independently of search budget. Any bot wrapper consuming a third-party bot MUST validate the returned cell against the live engine board, not trust the bot's output blindly.
- **L20** — *Argmax-only proxies (MCTS-1) are structurally below RandomBot.* `our_v6_argmax` (n_sims=1, temperature=0) went 0/300 — below randombot's 0/300-with-99-draws. The argmax-handicap memory (`feedback_v6_v8_same_training_data.md`) generalises beyond cross-encoding diagnostics: argmax-only mode is a degenerate strength sensor, only useful as a relative-direction signal, never as an absolute baseline.

**New Falsified Hypotheses Register row candidates:**

| § | Hypothesis | Falsified by | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| §176 Phase A | A3 — §175 selfplay terminal states are "one large diffuse cluster" | A3 §c-§d | Single-cluster fraction monotone-down 18.1%→6.3% across 20K–50K cohorts; modal pattern is multi-island fragmentation |
| §176 Phase A | V2 — KrakenBot MinimaxBot @ 1.0s > @ 0.1s | Wave C V2 | BT delta −5 Elo, head-to-head 20-30 favouring 0.1s; iterative deepening saturates at depth 4 in our off-distribution game |
| §176 Phase A | V5 — our v6 bootstrap @ MCTS-128 strictly between RandomBot and weakest Kraken | Wave C V5 | bootstrap MCTS-128 is the 2nd-strongest bot in the tourney (BT −62 vs sealbot); ~3030 Elo above RandomBot |

**Forward pointer:** §176 Phase B implementation (S1–S6 per `reports/s176_d_plan.md` §2) opens on a fresh branch (TBD). Recommended 6 commits ≤10 cap. Mix-ratio bot-pool weights (sealbot 50 / our_v6 30 / kraken_strong 15 / kraken_random 5) per S4 design doc. Source B (live cross-bot) is design-only this sprint; subprocess isolation mandatory per A4 do-not #1.

## §176 — Phase A Gate 1 + Gate 2 + Gate 3 close-out (2026-05-15)

Branch `phase4.5/s176_phase_a_validation`. Three-gate operator-mandated cycle: (1) fresh-context independent review of Phase A artifacts (Wave E was the implementer-adjacent fresh-context audit; Gate 1 is a second pass per L13), (2) §175 interrupt + 70K vast tourney for tide-vs-recover empirical answer, (3) step-20K checkpoint promotion to weights-only bootstrap artifact.

### Gate 1 — operator review, verdict **STRENGTHEN_ONLY**

`reports/s176_gate1_operator_review.md`. 7 dimensions audited: D1–D5 cites (12 claims PASS), Wave C BT-ladder reproducibility (3 H2H pairs reproduced from `per_game.jsonl` — sealbot vs our_v6_mcts128 25/25, sealbot vs kraken_strong 49/1, sealbot vs randombot 50/0), `_smart_legal_fallback` correctness (`hexo_rl/bots/krakenbot_bot.py:34` imports `_D2_OFFSETS` from vendor — no divergent reimplementation), Falsified Register hygiene (16 rows walked; §17 GIL daemon row explicitly cited in plan S5 mandate), L18 sufficiency (PASS with strengthening note — n=50 H2H, BT CI [-150, +26] crosses zero; lesson body should disclose CI), risk register (7 rows ≥ 5 floor; 5 non-blocking strengthening notes captured for Phase B prep).

One process-note dimension: V1–V6 pre-registration is not committed as a separate artifact (`reports/s176_c_tourney/verdicts.txt` is post-hoc results dump). Honest FAIL declarations on V1, V4, V5 are weak evidence of integrity; operator vouches pre-registration. Gate 2 verdicts (V70K-1..5) committed BEFORE tourney in `reports/s176_gate2_verdicts.txt` — establishes audit-trail pattern for Phase B.

### Gate 2 — §175 interrupt + 70K tourney on vast 5080, verdict **MIXED**

`reports/s176_gate2_tourney/{summary.md,verdicts_v70k.md,ratings.csv,h2h_matrix.csv,per_game.jsonl}` + `reports/s175_forensics/`.

§175 interrupt was a no-op: session ended cleanly at step 70176 at 2026-05-14T20:56Z (SIGINT during sealbot eval game 37/100; `shutdown_save=True` triggered, buffer persisted, final checkpoint flushed). tmux session `s175` detached, kept for state preservation. Forensics archived locally: 21 eval-DB rows, checkpoint_log.json, training-step tail (5000 lines), shutdown events.

Tourney: 5 bots × 50 games/pair × 10 pairs = 500 games, 6551.1 s wall (well under 4-hr cap). Participants: `our_v6_latest` (step 70000, MCTS-128), `our_v6_step20k` (step 20000, MCTS-128), `our_v6_bootstrap` (bootstrap_model_v6.pt, MCTS-128), `sealbot` (think_time=0.5s), `kraken_minimax_strong` (time_limit=1.0s).

**Pre-registered verdicts (V70K-1..5):**

| ID | Hypothesis | Observed | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| V70K-1 | 70K vs SealBot WR ≥ 17.4% | 25/50 = 50.0%, Wilson95 [36.6, 63.4] | **PASS (greedy mode)** |
| V70K-2 | 20K stronger than 70K H2H | step20k vs latest 50/0 = 100% | **PASS strong** |
| V70K-3 | 70K improved over own bootstrap | latest vs bootstrap 50/0 = 100% | **PASS strong** |
| V70K-4 | 70K col-frac (winner-side) ≤ 65% | 100% col>0.3 rate, mean col-frac 63.3%, n_components 14.90 | **FAIL strong** |
| V70K-5 | 70K vs Kraken strong WR ≥ 60% | 49/50 = 98.0%, Wilson95 [89.5, 99.6] | **PASS strong** |

**Critical methodology divergence.** `tournament_validate.py` runs `OurModelBot` at `temperature=0.0` (greedy argmax). §175 `eval_pipeline.py` defaults to `eval_temperature=0.5` (stochastic). Two distinct play modes from the same weights produce radically different rankings. §175 trajectory was 18.0% → 4.0% (T=0.5, n=100) across 20K → 70K. This tourney shows 0.0% → 50.0% (T=0.0, n=50) across the same checkpoints. The H2H 50-0 results between checkpoints reflect 2-effective-unique-games × 25 P1/P2 repetitions inflated to Wilson95 [92.9%, 100%] — over-confident at greedy-mode determinism.

**Interpretation:**
1. V70K-2 PASS strong is robust across both modes (step20k > latest in greedy 50-0; step20k > latest in sampled 18% > 4%). **20K-as-bootstrap decision validated.** Both methodologies agree.
2. V70K-3 PASS strong contradicts L18's "regressed past own bootstrap" framing for greedy mode but is silent on sampled mode (no eval-pipeline measurement of latest_70K vs bootstrap). **L18 needs refinement** (see L21 below).
3. V70K-4 FAIL strong (100% col>0.3 rate for latest_70K wins, n_components 14.90) is the most important finding — **attractor fully captured the latest_70K argmax distribution**, sitting right at the §176 Phase B warning threshold (`n_components ≥ 15`). Argues for aggressive bot-game mixing in Source A; Section 3 weights in `s176_d_plan.md` remain sound.
4. V70K-1 PASS is mode-qualified. Greedy parity with sealbot at step 70K is real (25/25) but DOES NOT contradict the §175 sampled-eval 4% slide.

### Gate 3 — step-20K promotion, verdict **PROMOTED with n=20 caveat**

`reports/s176_gate3/smoke_eval.md` + `checkpoints/bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.{pt,json}`.

- Source: §175 `checkpoint_00020000.pt` (run `c7e74d2842404a82bdd9f62edf740ea2`), source SHA256 `540ac1cf91be38c21b8c10267d36828f34aec242d89c51bc4fd0ea6f2a8680ca`.
- Artifact: `checkpoints/bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.pt`, SHA256 `297e0ce0e48c8c9c417d923610de6ed0166c7295789ebc7bd029c90bb42bce6a`, 17.0 MB (weights-only per §34: only `model_state` + `metadata` retained; optimizer/scaler/scheduler stripped).
- Sidecar: `checkpoints/bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.json`.
- Extraction verification: tensor-equality 143/143 keys MATCH source; round-trip `load_state_dict(strict=True)` returns `<All keys matched successfully>`; `python -m hexo_rl.encoding audit` reports `v6 v6 OK` (declared==inferred).
- Smoke eval: matched §175 methodology (`eval_temperature=0.5`, per-game seed) → 1/20 = 5.0% Wilson95 [0.9%, 23.6%]; binomial P(X≤1 | n=20, p=0.18) = 0.10 — consistent with §175 18/100 anchor at α=0.10; n=20 noise dominates point estimate. Master-prompt STOP boundary (< 5%) not strictly triggered. **Promotion approved.**
- Vast parity: artifact + sidecar pushed; SHA matches both hosts.
- `bootstrap_model.pt` symlink UNTOUCHED (§175-era reproducibility preserved).

### Retained baselines — new row

| Anchor | Path | SHA256 | Source step / run | Eval WR (n=100) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v6_step20k (§176 Gate 3) | `checkpoints/bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.pt` | `297e0ce0…2bce6a` | §175 step 20000 / `c7e74d…40ea2` | 18.0% [11.7, 26.7] vs SealBot | Empirical §175 sampled-eval peak; weights-only per §34 |

### New mechanism lessons (L21+)

- **L21** — *Eval temperature mode change can invert checkpoint rankings.* §175 step-20K vs SealBot at T=0.5 is 18.0% (peak across §175); same checkpoint at T=0.0 (greedy argmax) is 0.0%. §175 step-70K at T=0.5 is 4.0%; at T=0.0 it ties sealbot 25/25. The argmax-mode and sampled-mode are effectively **two different bots** from the same weights. Any cross-tooling comparison must declare temperature; defaulting to `eval_temperature=0.5` is the convention for §175-era continuity.
- **L22** — *L18 head-drift refinement.* §175 internal drift between 20K and 70K is **policy-distribution flattening into colony attractor** under T=0.5 sampling, NOT loss of argmax dominance over bootstrap. V70K-3 PASS strong (latest dominates bootstrap 50-0 in greedy) + V70K-4 FAIL strong (100% colony-spam wins for latest, n_components 14.90) + §175 eval trajectory (18% → 4% sampled) jointly pin the mechanism. L18 should read "*sampled-policy regression into colony attractor*", not "*regressed past bootstrap*".
- **L23** — *H2H 50-0 in greedy-argmax tourneys is 2 effective unique games × 25 P1/P2 repetitions.* `tournament_validate.py` with `temperature=0.0`, `dirichlet_enabled=False`, `random_opening_plies=0`, and sealbot's roughly-deterministic 0.5s response produces 2 distinct game trajectories per pair (one per opening side). Wilson95 intervals on the inflated n=50 are over-confident. For 20K-as-bootstrap-style discriminator runs, this is acceptable as a sign-test (direction); for absolute strength estimates, prefer eval_pipeline at T=0.5 to inject per-game variance.

### New Falsified Hypotheses Register rows

| § | Hypothesis | Falsified by | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| §176 Phase A Gate 2 | V70K-4 — §175 step-70K winner-side col-frac ≤ 65% (attractor weakened by training past 50K) | V70K-4 strong FAIL (100% col>0.3 rate, n_components 14.90) | Attractor captured the policy. Greedy-mode wins are uniformly colony-spam patterns. |
| §176 Phase A Gate 2 | L18 strict reading — "§175 latest_70K regressed past its own bootstrap on the selfplay axis" | V70K-3 PASS strong (50-0 H2H latest dominates bootstrap in greedy argmax) | Drift is sampled-mode policy-distribution flattening, not argmax-mode regression. See L22. |
| §176 Phase A Gate 1 | Operator-prompted L18 framing requires no statistical disclaimer at n=50 | Gate 1 dim (vi) — BT 95% CI [-150, +26] crosses zero; H2H 25/25 is parity-consistent only at n=50, NOT strongly-asserted parity | L18 lesson body should disclose CI; framing already correct ("can match") |

### Phase B anchor decision

**Anchor for §176 Phase B sustained: `checkpoints/bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.pt`** (Gate 3 artifact). Validated by:
- V70K-2 PASS strong (20K dominates latest in greedy 50-0)
- §175 sampled-eval (18% vs 4% across 20K vs 70K)
- Both methodologies agree direction.

Phase B implementation opens on a fresh branch (S1–S6 per `reports/s176_d_plan.md`). Mix-ratio bot-pool weights per Section 3 unchanged. **Add eval-temperature pin to all sustained smoke prompts** (recommend T=0.5 for §175 continuity).

### Phase A close

PR #8 mergeable. §175 tmux detached but session preserved. Replay buffer (2.9 GB + 77 MB .recent.npz), 24 checkpoints from step 5000 to 70176, structlog jsonl (49 MB train + 51 MB events) all intact on vast under `c7e74d2842404a82bdd9f62edf740ea2`.

## §176 — Phase B pre-launch baseline (2026-05-15)

Pre-Phase-B fix wave landed on `phase4.5/s176_phase_a_validation`: six commits absorbing F01–F05 SHOULD-FIX from `reports/s176_review_findings.md` + F06 + F09 N1+N3+N4 cheap STRENGTHEN items. Phase B launch prompt committed as pre-registered done-when artifact per Gate 1 §145 Note 5.

**Forward pointer:** §176 Phase B prompt artifact at `reports/s176_phase_b_prompt.md` (pinned at commit `3994459`). A future Opus session reads that file top-to-bottom and executes Phase B S1–S6 end-to-end. Anchor for Phase B: `checkpoints/bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.pt` (SHA `297e0ce0…2bce6a`, 18.0% n=100 vs SealBot [11.7%, 26.7%]). Forensics specimen retained: `checkpoints/checkpoint_00070000.pt` (L22 attractor-capture witness; F07 deferred to Phase B S6 close-out for retention metadata sidecar OR `docs/rules/checkpoint-archive-policy.md` retention note).

Phase B scope: S1 wrapper audit + anchor n=100 re-baseline (F08), S2 dual-temperature eval ladder + Q14 close, S3 `n_components` colony POC at `pool.py game_complete` selfplay-mode emit, S4 Source A static corpus mixing design doc (lowered-expected-benefit framing per L22), S5 Source B live cross-bot games design doc (elevated to primary-fix-mechanism candidate per L22 + V6 PASS opponent-coupling), S6 close-out. Pre-registered verdicts V-PhaseB-1..9 freeze at the artifact's commit SHA per L13 + A4 do-not #9.

Phase B does NOT run a sustained training smoke; design docs queue for §177+ implementation. Pre-Phase-B fix wave commits `1d5b6b5..2014669`:

## §177-pre — Wave A1 baseline (n=100 dual-temperature SealBot eval) — 2026-05-15

Operator-driven Wave A1 ahead of S1–S6 implementation: 30-s SHA parity re-check + n=100 dual-temperature SealBot eval of the §176 Phase A anchor + variant config authoring + §177 training launch from the step-20K anchor (NOT Phase B's design-only scope; Phase B S1–S6 sequence still queued for a future session against this baseline).

**Anchor SHA parity re-check (vast 5080, post-master-pull 7d4b4fb).** PASS both:
- `bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.pt` → `297e0ce0e48c8c9c417d923610de6ed0166c7295789ebc7bd029c90bb42bce6a` (17,035,312 B) ✓ matches expected

**n=100 dual-temperature SealBot baseline** (MCTS-128, `random_opening_plies=0`, `time_limit=0.5`, seed_base=42):

**Pre-registered verdicts BL-1..BL-4 (operator prompt) — disposition.** Three of the four were NULL'd: the operator's pre-registration conflated greedy vs sampled modes for the anchor-reproduction test, but §175 step-20K's documented 18% is the **sampled** number per `eval.yaml::eval_temperature=0.5`, and L21 explicitly establishes **greedy=0%** for the same checkpoint. NULL'd per L13 + skill `investigation-probe-smoke-verdict` anti-pattern #1 (don't rewrite report to fit verdict).

| ID | User-pre-registered hypothesis | Literal verdict | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| BL-1 | Greedy n=100 reproduces §175 step-20K eval (PASS: WR ∈ [11.7, 26.7]) | FAIL (0% vs 18% expected) | **NULL — basis invalidated by L21.** §175 18% is sampled mode (`eval_temperature: 0.5` pin); L21 explicitly states step-20K **greedy = 0.0%**. The 0/100 greedy result EXACTLY reproduces L21's documented greedy-mode value. Reframed: GREEDY_L21_REPRO = PASS. |
| BL-2 | Sampled diverges from greedy ≥ 6pp absolute per L21 | PASS (12pp) | **PASS** — L21 dual-mode divergence confirmed at the Phase B baseline. Locks dual-temperature gate scope for Phase B S2. |
| BL-3 | Sampled WR < greedy WR (matches §175 trajectory direction) | FAIL (sampled > greedy by 12pp) | **NULL — basis invalidated by L22.** Sampled > greedy at step-20K is the normal **pre-flattening** ordering (exploration-spread baseline). The §175 trajectory direction (sampled < greedy) emerges **post-flattening** at step-70K per V70K-3 PASS strong + §175 eval slide 18%→4%. BL-3's framing should be applied to a post-flattening checkpoint, not the pre-flattening anchor. Sampled-canonical meta-claim PASSes independently via eval.yaml `eval_temperature: 0.5` pin + L21 convention. |
| BL-4 | Colony fraction in sampled wins ≥ greedy wins by ≥ 10pp | undefined | **NULL — greedy wins=0 ⇒ divisor zero.** No greedy-side colony rate computable. Sampled-side colony measurement deferred to Phase B S3 implementation. |

**Phase B prompt S1 re-baseline verdict (canonical).** Per Section 6 V-PhaseB-5 + Section 3 S1 PASS criterion (point-estimate-in-original-CI):

- Sampled n=100 = 12.0%, point estimate **12.0% ∈ [11.7%, 26.7%]** (original §175 anchor CI).
- **V-PhaseB-5 verdict: PASS** (anchor preserved by extraction; tensor-equality + behavioral-equality both green).
- Wilson95 of 12/100 = [7.0%, 19.8%] overlaps but does not contain §175 [11.7%, 26.7%]; point-estimate criterion is what the Phase B prompt pre-registered, and it is met.
- F08 SHOULD-RE-BASELINE deferred-strengthen item now CLOSED.

**Mode comparison signature (Wave A1 forensics).**

- Greedy mean_ply 77.4 (long grinding losses, no termination via win).
- Sampled mean_ply 52.7 (12 wins terminate games earlier; sampled exploration shortens losing trajectories too).
- Sampled-greedy elapsed asymmetry: 1722 s vs 1129 s (greedy 1.5× sampled wall-time despite identical MCTS budget) — sampled's shorter games dominate.

**Variant config + training launch.** Authored `configs/variants/v6_sustained_s177.yaml` (commit `166ac7c` on master): clone of §175 `v6_sustained.yaml` with bootstrap delta only (CLI `--checkpoint` flag); L9 cosine-temp + jitter pairing preserved, `random_opening_plies=0`, `eval_interval=10000`, n_games=100, total_steps=100000. Dashboard port falls back to `monitoring.yaml` default 5001 (vast port 8080 occupied by jupyter-notebook pid 690). §177 training launched on vast 5080 in tmux `s177` from `bootstrap_model_v6_step20k.pt` along the §175 recipe — empirical zero-point for Phase B Wave C source-mixing experiments. No bot-game mixing (Source A/B arrive after Phase B S1–S6 land).

## Supplementary tables — preserved from per-§ bodies

### §70 mode-collapse evidence (round-robin signature)

| Matchup | Score | Game length |
|---|---|---|
| ckpt_13000 vs ckpt_14000 | 100/0 P1 | exactly 25 moves, carbon-copy |
| ckpt_14000 vs ckpt_15000 | 50/0 P1 + 50 draws | 31-33 moves, carbon-copy |
| ckpt_15000 vs RandomBot | 50/0 P1 | 11-33, varied |

H(π) band 1.49–1.70 (post-collapse) vs bootstrap 2.665 — entire post-bootstrap band sits within 0.21 nats. Fixed point, not progressive collapse. Restart should select on buffer composition, not entropy rank.

### §73 Dirichlet port verification (commit `71d7e6e`)

| Site | Count post-port | §70 count |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_dirichlet_to_root` | 10 | **0** |
| `game_runner` | 30 | 30 |

10 unique noise vectors across workers. Top-1 prior: `0.540 → 0.412` post-noise (−12.8pp). Top-1 visit fraction at cm=0: 0.474 vs §70 baseline 0.65 (−17.6pp). Workers at cm=0 ply=0 span 0.33–0.55 (diverging vs §70 identical across 14 workers).

### §91 / §100.d threat-probe criterion (locked, REVISED from §85/§89)

| # | Condition | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | contrast_mean ≥ max(0.38, 0.8 × bootstrap_contrast) | floor 0.40 (bootstrap=0.502) |
| C2 | ext_in_top5_pct ≥ 40 | direct colony-spam test |
| C3 | ext_in_top10_pct ≥ 60 | catches partial sharpness |
| C4 | abs(ext_logit_mean − bootstrap_ext_logit_mean) < 5.0 | **warning only, never gates** |

C1–C3 must all PASS for `make probe.latest` exit 0. C4 is BCE-drift / Q19 monitoring hook. Baseline `fixtures/threat_probe_baseline.json` v6 (§106 real-position regen): contrast 0.502, top5 50%, top10 65%.

### §116 torch.compile retry — three-mode comparison (PT 2.11 + Py 3.14)

| Metric | Eager | default | reduce-overhead | max-autotune-no-cudagraphs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Throughput batch=64 (pos/s) | 2,529 | 3,665 | **3,788** | 3,744 |
| Throughput speedup vs eager | 1.00× | 1.45× | **1.50×** | 1.48× |
| Latency batch=1 (mean ms) | 3.553 | 2.844 | **1.897** | 3.007 |
| Latency speedup vs eager | 1.00× | 1.25× | **1.87×** | 1.18× |
| Compile time | — | 11.8 s | **6.4 s** | 29.9 s |
| Graph breaks | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**§116.a landed then reverted (`1e2d82b` + `41ffad5` mode-plumbing/OptimizedModule unwrap stay; `e102a0a` flag flipped back to `false`)** — second resume at step 6002 hit futex_do_wait on 78 threads (trainer+inference dual-JIT). Re-enable preconditions documented inline.

### §118 → §121 axis-clustering causal chain

```
RecentBuffer un-augmented (67% of late-training batch)
  → absolute-position FC policy head learns axis-asymmetric features freely
  → MCTS visits concentrate on preferred E-W axis (no symmetry pressure)
  → self-play generates axis-biased trajectories
  → RecentBuffer samples reinforce bias at 67% of gradient
  → loop closes; bias grows monotonically until truncation or intervention
```

§120 closed the symmetry coverage gap (4.7/12 → 12/12 group elements per batch row) but **augmentation alone is insufficient** for relational biases (D13 heuristic preserved under rigid transformation). Two independent components in §121 — directional heuristic (rotation-equivariant, fixed by §130 permanent rotation) + clustering magnitude (rotation-invariant, architectural). §122 architectural redesign blocked on B1 D17 ablation + B2 backbone-form memo + B3 retrain cost + B4 buffer compat.

### §156 R10 within-bisection (each variant removes ONE knob from R10)

| Variant | Knob removed | n | draws | draw_rate (95% CI) | mean_ply | stride5 P50/P90 | colony_wins | wall |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| R10 | (full smoke regime) | 200 | 182 | 91.0% [86.2%, 94.2%] | 140 | 84/97 | 9 | 2702s |
| R11 | Dirichlet ε=0.10 → 0 | 200 | 176 | 88.0% [82.8%, 91.8%] | 139 | 76/86 | 15 | 2649s |
| **R12** | **cosine temp → fixed τ=0.5** | 200 | 10 | **5.0% [2.7%, 9.0%]** | 63 | **3/4** | 134 | 738s |
| R13 | opening_plies 1 → 4 | 200 | 170 | 85.0% [79.4%, 89.3%] | 135 | 82/100 | 15 | 2620s |
| R14 | playout cap → uniform 600 | 200 | 198 | 99.0% [96.4%, 99.7%] | 149 | 132/133 | 0 | 3576s |

R12 colony rate 67% (134/200) is the §147 v5 / §154 v9 colony attractor — mitigated by `legal_move_radius_jitter: true` + `bootstrap_floor.min_winrate: 0.45`.

### §157 5k smoke abort-signatures (5080, 1256 games, wall 3h 18m)

| Signature | End-of-run | Threshold | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| stride-5 P90 (rolling 50 games) | 4 | 60 | ✅ |
| row max P90 (rolling 50 games) | 13 | 50 | ✅ |
| colony_ext_frac max (per-game) | 0.086 | 0.40 | ✅ |
| colony_terminal_fraction | 0.000 | — | ✅ |
| draw_rate (last 200 games) | 7.5% | 70% (WARN-only) | ✅ |
| grad_norm | 0.98–1.62 | 10.0 hard-abort | ✅ |
| NaN losses | 0 | any | ✅ |

Final-ckpt SealBot offline eval n=200: **19.0% (38/200)** — beats 17% gate, matches §150 v7full 17.4% n=500 within sample noise.

### §167 Phase B v8 variant matrix retrains (5080 + laptop, 30 epochs each)

| Arm | Final loss | NaN-skip rate | SealBot argmax n=200 |
|---|---|---|---|
| B0 (128×12, no GPool) | 3.2737 | 0% | 0/200 |
| **B1 retry (128×12 + GPool {6,10})** | **3.227** | 24% NaN-skipped (`4c7dbb5` `isfinite` guard) | 0/200 |
| B2 (96×12 + GPool, laptop) | 3.276 | 0% | 0/200 |
| B3 (128×10 + GPool {5,8}) | 3.2536 | 0% | 0/200 |
| B4 (160×12 + GPool, batch 128 fallback) | 3.2249 (~6 ep effective) | 80% NaN-skipped | 0/200 |

v7full v6-argmax baseline radius curve: r=5 6.5% / r=8 12.5% / r=10 15%. B1 across radii r=8/10/12: 0%/0%/0%. **Cross-encoding argmax-only handicap is structural** — K-cluster's inference-time multi-window pooling acts as tiny ensemble that bbox lacks. Effect vanishes under MCTS (Phase D §168).

### §169 four-way ablation matrix (post-§169a probe)

| Arm | Encoding | Pool | Loss (30 ep) | argmax @ r=8 n=200 | MCTS-128 n=200 | params (M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1 (canonical)** | v6w25 (25×25 K-cluster) | min/max | **3.57** | **14.5%** [10.3%, 20.0%] | 25% (§169 P1 MCTS-32 n=20) | 5.29 |
| A2 | v6w25 K-cluster | PMA | 4.25 | 4.5% [2.4%, 8.3%] | 3.5% [1.7%, 7.0%] | 6.30 |
| A3 | v6w25 K-cluster | PMA + global token | 3.62 | 7.5% [4.6%, 12.0%] | 2.5% [1.1%, 5.7%] | 6.37 |
| A4 | v8 bbox + canvas_realness + PartialConv2d | KataGo head | **3.47** | **0.0%** [0.0%, 1.9%] | **0.0%** [0.0%, 1.9%] | 3.85 |

A3 learned `pool_global_gate` climbed 0.10 → 0.66 (6.6× over init) — global branch earns weight, lifts policy argmax, but doesn't fix PMA's K=1-pretrain-regime cross-cluster blindness at search time.

### §170 P4 P1 gpool-bias-policy-only (CANONICAL)

A1+gpool-bias-policy-only retrain → **22% argmax SealBot @ r=8 n=200**. Full gpool-bias on both heads (P3) is NULL on value. Earlier attribution of 22% lift to A4 fine-tune was wrong (memory `project_bootstrap_argmax_drift_check_20260511.md` documents correction); A4 was already 0% pre-fine-tune. Mechanism: gpool-bias on policy head only, applied on A1 K-cluster.

### §172 A10 close-out — high-risk hazard retirement

| # | Site | Hazard | Closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | `engine/src/game_runner/mod.rs:159` `SelfPlayRunner::new` | pyo3 default kwargs silent v6 fallback (`feature_len=8*19*19`, `policy_len=19*19+1`) | derive from `spec.state_stride()`/`spec.policy_stride()`; legacy-caller backward-compat retained |

A10 commits: ab760ae (T1 stamp model_variant), ae97525 (T2 migrations consolidate), a133d52 (T3 DeprecationWarning), 2dc086f (T4 RegistrySpec accessors), 1262e0c (T5 retire `*_V8` const presets), 823e241 (T6 retire `config["board_size"]`), e2a73f5 (T7 cross-table consistency INV-1..6), e83e78a (T8a allowlist 881→201 hits), f7c2bc8 (T8b HIGH-RISK pyo3 fix), 47b7f17 (T9 `<auto>` config form), 1595008 (T10 model-variant backfill), 576f69d (T11 pyo3 `from_py_object` TODO).

### §172 Phase B B2 milestone curve (30K v7full sustained, n=20)

| Step | sealbot | bootstrap_anchor | best_arena (n=100) | argmax_n | elo | promoted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5K  | 0.100 | 0.350 | 0.410 | 0.000 | -94.2 | F |
| 10K | 0.200 | 0.600 | 0.570 | 0.000 | +50.5 | F (CI block) |
| 15K | 0.050 | 0.650 | 0.500 | 0.000 |  -9.4 | F |
| **20K** | **0.050** | **0.650** | **0.610** | 0.000 | +34.0 | **T** (only promotion) |
| 25K | 0.050 | 0.500 | 0.560 | 0.000 | -63.2 | F (CI block) |
| 30K | 0.050 | 0.600 | 0.550 | 0.000 | -36.3 | F (CI block) |

§150 v7full anchor SealBot 17.4% n=500. B2 finished sealbot 0.050 n=20 Wilson95 [0.009, 0.236]. **REGRESSION gate did not fire** (UB 0.236 covers anchor LB 0.143). DRIFT gate cold (argmax_n 0/20 all rounds). Self-play improving vs self (best_arena 0.41 → 0.61) while sealbot stalled — **encoder-specific transfer gap, not value-drift pathology**.

### §173 bench gate (pre-α vs post-A5b v2, n=5, 90s warmup, compile OFF)

| Metric | Pre-α median | Post-A5b v2 | Δ | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MCTS sim/s | 80,601 | 80,287 | −0.4% | ≥ 26,000 | PASS |
| NN inference pos/s | 14,278 | 14,148 | −0.9% | ≥ 8,250 | PASS |
| NN latency ms | 1.551 | 1.537 | −0.9% | ≤ 3.5 | PASS |
| Buffer push pos/s | 992,777 | 1,023,047 | +3.1% | ≥ 630,000 | PASS |
| Buffer sample raw µs | 757 | 764 | +0.9% | ≤ 1,550 | PASS |
| Buffer sample aug µs | 759 | 768 | +1.2% | ≤ 1,800 | PASS |
| GPU util % | 94.0 | 94.0 | — | ≥ 85% | PASS |
| VRAM GB | 0.105 | 0.105 | — | ≤ 6.4 | PASS |
| Worker pos/hr | 80,715 | **104,141** | **+28.9%** | ≥ 250,000 | PASS |
| Batch fill % | 99.999 | 99.976 | −0.02pp | ≥ 80% | PASS |

A5b initial −10.47% worker_pos_per_hr regression recovered to +6.01% via scalar-API + `#[inline]` (`feedback_registryspec_by_ref_in_hotpath.md` — RegistrySpec ~174-byte copy per MCTS sim).

### §173 HAZARD ledger (closed)

| HAZARD | Description | Closed by |
|---|---|---|
| H1-α | SymTables v6 unconditional → K-window rotation silent shape mismatch | A5a (`sym_tables_for()`) |
| H2-α | `rotate_aux_inplace` TOTAL_CELLS=361 silent ownership corruption for v6w25 | A5a |
| H3-α | `views[k][..TOTAL_CELLS]` truncates chain encoding for v6w25 | A5a |
| H4-α | `aggregate_policy*` BOARD_SIZE=19 — 362-vector where 626 required | A5b |
| H5-α | `sample.rs:220` pass-slot copy: latent OOB for v8 (`has_pass_slot=false`) | A4 |
| H6-α | `mod.rs:342 STATE_STRIDE` v6 constant in `collect_data` | A5a |
| H7-α | HEXB on-disk format has no encoding-name header — blocks first v6w25 persist | **CARRIED to §174** |

Python `EncodingSpec.n_cells` parity bug (used `board_size²` instead of `trunk_size²`) closed by A3.

### §174 bootstrap matrix (post-mortem)

| Bootstrap | Recipe | Final loss | SealBot MCTS-128 (random_plies=0) | Selfplay median plies @ R=8 | G4 status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **v6 (`bootstrap_model.pt`)** | 30 ep cosine 2e-3/5e-5 | — | reference | reference | PASS — §175 anchor |
| v7full | 30 ep cosine 2e-3/5e-5 | 3.1573 | 17.4% n=500 (§150) | — | PASS |
| v6w25 e30 | 30 ep cosine 1e-3/5e-5 | 3.96 nats vs uniform | **0% (0/200)** | 6 | PASS within band |
| v6w25 e50 | 50 ep cosine 1e-3/5e-5 | (lower) | 10% (10/100, artifact-suspect) | 6 | **MARGINAL FAIL** 0.489 vs band [0.154, 0.462] |
| v6w25 transfer FT | v6 trunk + Xavier policy FC + drop-restart FT | — | **0% (0/200)** | 8 | — |

Eval random_opening_plies 4 → 0 in `configs/eval.yaml:88` fully explains §168 → §174 sealbot WR drop (14.5% → 0%) — with 4 random plies model got free positional diversity masking weaknesses; with 0 SealBot's preparation lands cleanly.

### G-gate wiring status (Track 2 audit, 2026-05-13)

| Gate | Description | Wiring |
|---|---|---|
| G3 | Monotonic depth scaling | `avg_game_length` in `iteration_complete` (orchestrator.py:336); per-game `game_length` in structlog `game_complete` (pool.py:593) |
| G4 | Value-head |max| ±50% band [0.154, 0.462] around v7full 0.308 | **NEW §174 Track 2** — `_g4_value_head_band_check` runs at start of every `run_evaluation`; result persisted in `results["value_fc2_weight_abs_max"]` + `results["g4_value_head_band_pass"]`; structlog WARNING on violation; constants gate-internal (variants do not override) |
| G5 | Per-cluster variance drift ≤30% | `cluster_value_std_mean` + `cluster_policy_disagreement_mean` + `cluster_variance_sample_count` emitted in `iteration_complete` (orchestrator.py:349-351) + `train_step_summary` (orchestrator.py:404-406); drift detection is post-hoc operator computation |

`random_opening_plies` two distinct fields (selfplay vs eval paths): `selfplay.random_opening_plies` (`configs/selfplay.yaml:66` default 1, vast.yaml override 0); `eval_pipeline.eval_random_opening_plies` (`configs/eval.yaml:88` default 0, was 4 pre-§174). Pipeline build path `pipeline_setup.py:52` loads eval.yaml directly — separate from training base-config list.

### §174 escalation decision matrix

| Track 1 finding | §175 action |
|---|---|
| e30 v6w25 ≥ §150 v7full anchor on MCTS-128 sealbot n=100 | Launch sustained with e30 v6w25 |
| e30 v6w25 < §150 anchor by > 5pp absolute | Re-evaluate: retrain with different recipe OR fall back to v7full for §174 |
| e30 v6w25 within ±5pp of §150 anchor (within noise) | Launch sustained — gap is in measurement noise; α + radius curriculum are net new levers |

Track 1 returned 0% MCTS-128 across all three v6w25 bootstrap recipes → escalation to §175 v6 sustained (100K steps, n=100 SealBot eval, matched cosine LR from §174 vast.yaml, selfplay encoding v6 single-window 19×19 existing path).

## §178 — Rust engine refactor cycle 1 close (2026-05-15 → 2026-05-16)

Branch `refactor/rust-engine`. Three-wave cycle bracketed by a 90-proposal Phase 3 audit pass at `audit/rust-engine/00_aggregated_proposals.md` + per-file split addendum at `audit/rust-engine/01_file_split_addendum.md`. Wave 1 = foundation (docs + clippy floor + LazyLock migration). Wave 2 = dead-code purge (six commits, net −789 LOC, bitboard module + mcts dead setters + dead lib.rs PyO3 surfaces). Wave 3 = hot-path correctness (P1 silent v6w25 corruption, P2 v8 `has_pass_slot` dispatch, P3 cross-language `EncodingSpec` retirement) + pre-3d hygiene (Python test consumer cleanup, NN-latency triangulation). Cycle bench gate PASS; INV15+INV16+INV17 pinned; 6 settled decisions migrated below.

**Forward pointer:** archive consolidation at `reports/sprint_archive/§178_rust_engine_audit.md` (user post-cycle action — see `audit/rust-engine/wave_3/3d/archive_prep_note.md`). Source-of-truth audit tree retained at `audit/rust-engine/` for forensic reference until archive lands; SD1–SD6 are cite-from-future-prompts surface.

### Cycle metrics

- Test counts at cycle close: **Rust 249** tests (across 17 binaries, 0 fail) + **Python 1549 / 1 failed / 18 skipped / 4 deselected / 1 xpassed** (the 1 failure is `tests/test_policy_target_metrics.py::test_cost_budget_under_200us_at_b256` — a timing-budget flake under concurrent `make bench` GPU contention; the test's own docstring discloses 10× idle-baseline tolerance specifically to handle this scenario, and the budget tripped today only because `make test.py` ran while `make bench` was holding 100% GPU. Not a Wave 3 code regression — pre-cycle suite was 1550/0 fail post-H1 measurement.)
- Clippy floor: `cargo clippy --release` exit 0, **190 lib warnings** (Wave 1 opened gate at 199; Wave 2 closed at 192; Wave 3 closed at 190 — strict downward trend across cycle).
- Cycle bench gate: **PASS** per `audit/rust-engine/wave_3/3d/cycle_bench_verdict.md`. 9 metrics measured at HEAD = `d74972a`; `all_targets_met` PASS. Cumulative vs Wave 2 close (SD5 anchor): MCTS sim/s +3.23%, NN inf +0.13%, NN latency +8.91% (PASS-WITH-WATCH per SD6), buffer push +14.86% IMPROVED, sample raw −16.08% IMPROVED, sample aug −8.25% IMPROVED, GPU flat, worker pos/hr −4.36% (PASS-WITH-WATCH per SD6), batch fill +1.01%. Cumulative vs Phase 0: MCTS +72.97%, NN latency −6.27%, push +0.04%, raw −7.53%, aug +5.09%, worker −10.60% (inside ±12.5% IQR envelope), batch fill −0.72% — net cycle improvement on load-bearing MCTS sim/s, neutral elsewhere.

### Settled decisions

The six entries below were maintained in `audit/rust-engine/cycle_settled_decisions.md` during the cycle and are cited from future Phase 4/5 prompts that touch the affected surfaces.

- **SD1 — P26 SKIP: `PyRegistrySpec::from_static` retained as `pub`.** Audit P26 proposed demoting `pub fn from_static` to `pub(crate)`; reality found at implementation: `engine/tests/test_worker_loop_v6w25_smoke.rs:69` calls it for §173 A5a v6w25 SelfPlayRunner construction guard. Integration tests are external to the crate; `pub(crate)` would break compilation. SKIP confirmed. Unblock conditions: migrate that test to `PyEncodingSpec::from_registry` (now retired — would need to be `PyRegistrySpec::from_registry`, available post-P3.1), OR expose `pub(crate)` in-crate constructor. Cite in any future prompt that touches `engine/src/lib.rs` `PyRegistrySpec` or registry constructor surface.

- **SD2 — P86 RETAIN: `v7` and `v7e30` registry entries kept.** P86 INVESTIGATE recommended INVESTIGATE; investigation found wire format `v7` byte-identical to `v6`, `v7e30` byte-identical to `v7full` — both legitimate historical names with zero production dispatch but loadable §148/§149/§150 ckpts depending on them. Cost RETAIN = 0 runtime (LazyLock lazy-init); RETIRE = 14 file edits + 2 ckpt renames + breakage risk. RETAIN AS-IS. SSR-collapse spirit applies to *duplicate* SoTs, not historical-tag entries in a single SoT TOML. Cite in any prompt touching `engine/src/encoding/registry.toml`.

- **SD3 — Per-commit scope-expansion-by-deletion is permitted.** Wave 2 + Wave 3 produced 8 forced scope expansions total (Wave 2: A→benches, B→d6_sym_tables, D→selection.rs; Wave 3: 3a→state.rs tests, 3b→3 test sites, 3c→4 Rust mod-tests + 5 positional-arg sites + `compat.py`/`pool.py` cascade, pre-3d H1→`inference_server.py`). All disclosed in commit bodies, all reviewer-approved, all minimal. Rule: expansion file MUST reference an in-scope deleted symbol; edit MUST be minimal (delete dead ref or migrate to surviving API); commit body MUST disclose; reviewer MUST confirm forced+minimal. Half-deletion that leaves the codebase non-compiling is worse. Cite under CONSTRAINTS in all Phase 4 implementer prompts. **Mechanism Lesson candidate L24** if pattern recurs in future cycles.

- **SD4 — Implementer/reviewer corrections to audit MD take precedence.** Wave 2 + Wave 3 found audit MD inaccuracies via implementation-time `rg` inventory: P15 audit said 10 dead PyMCTSTree setters → real 12; P26 audit said zero callers → integration test caller existed; P1 audit estimated 12 literal sites → impl observed 19 substitutions (some lines carried two `TOTAL_CELLS` each); 3b parent prompt CONSTRAINTS INVERTED v8 vs v6 pass-slot semantics (implementer followed registry); 3c PREP §D enumerated 3 deleted Rust mod-tests → reality was 4. Rule: implementer must run verification `rg` checks per their prompt's CONSTRAINTS section; if reality contradicts the audit MD findings count/caller list, report in commit body + adjust scope; if reality CONTRADICTS the proposal premise (e.g. "zero callers" falsified) → STOP and report. Cite under DONE-WHEN in all Phase 4 implementer prompts. **Mechanism Lesson candidate L25** if pattern recurs.

- **SD5 — Bench baseline re-anchored at Wave 2 close.** Phase 0 baseline measured at `072d0db` (pre-Wave-1) became stale after 6 dead-code-purge commits dropped 788 LOC. Re-snapshot at `fd22bc2` (`audit/rust-engine/wave_3/00_bench_baseline_post_wave_2_run2.txt`) is the formal Wave 3 cumulative bench-gate baseline. Phase 0 baseline preserved unchanged as canonical "before refactor cycle" measurement for Phase 5 bench audit + this § entry's transparency table. Cite as the "baseline" file path in any Wave 4+ bench-gate prompt.

- **SD6 — Mechanism-absent bench WATCH on small-absolute deltas is measurement variance until 2-3 commits confirm.** Promoted at 3d cycle close. NN latency b=1 trajectory across 6 measurements: 2.47 → 2.58 → 2.49 → 2.62 → 2.47 → 2.69, oscillating-revert without code mechanism (P1/P2/P3 don't touch NN paths; 3d and pre-3d H2 are the same HEAD `d74972a`). Independently confirmed on buffer push (3b WATCH → 3c → H2 +25.55%) and sample aug (3c → H2 −21.08%). Rule: WATCH metric is treated as measurement variance — NOT actionable — when code commit does not mechanistically explain it AND subsequent commits show non-monotonic/reverting behavior (or fresh-bench triangulation reverts toward baseline); escalated to investigation only when monotonic over 3+ commits AND code-level mechanism connects. Operator implication: future cycles do NOT freeze on a single-commit bench WATCH; require 2-commit confirmation OR fresh-bench triangulation. Cite this entry in Phase 4/5 bench-gate subagent prompts as the verdict heuristic.

### INV pin additions

- **INV15** — v6w25 encode round-trip regression pin (3a, `engine/tests/inv15_v6w25_encode_roundtrip.rs`, 3 `#[test]` fns: corner-cell byte-identity, v6 byte-identity-unchanged regression guard, v6w25 chain-plane axis runs)
- **INV16** — v8 has_pass_slot dispatch pin (3b, `engine/tests/inv16_v8_pass_slot_dispatch.rs`, 3 `#[test]` fns: v8 aggregate_policy preserves corner cell, v8 aggregate_policy_to_local preserves corner cell, v6 pass-slot zeroing regression guard)
- **INV17** — PyRegistrySpec.from_registry classmethod supersedes PyEncodingSpec (3c, Rust `engine/tests/inv17_pyregistryspec_supersedes_pyencodingspec.rs` 3 fns + Python `tests/test_inv17_pyregistryspec_retired.py` 2 fns)

### Open items deferred to Wave 4 / next cycle

- `engine/src/encoding/spec.rs` legacy Rust `EncodingSpec` struct + `Board::with_encoding` `cfg(test)`-only survivors (PREP 3c §A deferral). Kept as test-only fixtures pending operator review of test-only surface; not blocking but inelegant.
- `engine/src/lib.rs` → `pyo3/{board,mcts,encoding,utils}.rs` split (file-split addendum Wave-5 sequencing, dependencies now all settled — P3 done in 3c, Wave 2 deletes done in P15+P24+P25+P26-SKIP). Eligible Wave 4 candidate.
- `engine/src/game_runner/worker_loop.rs` split (881 LOC, INVESTIGATE) — blocked on P69 inline-test coverage per file-split addendum.
- `engine/src/game_runner/mod.rs` split (936 LOC) — DEFER confirmed; re-eval gates `[P22, P58]`.
- Remaining Phase 3 audit-pass proposals not addressed by Waves 1–3: tracked in `audit/rust-engine/00_aggregated_proposals.md`; next-cycle audit-pass should re-classify against post-cycle HEAD.

### Falsified Hypotheses Register additions

| § | Hypothesis | Falsified by | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| §178 (Wave 3 3b) | v8 `has_pass_slot=true` (parent prompt CONSTRAINTS claim) | 3b SD4 catch + INV16 Test A | Registry `engine/src/encoding/registry.toml` declares v8 has_pass_slot=false; implementer ran rg on registry source per SD4 and disregarded inverted parent claim; INV16 Test A pins the corner-cell-preserved-when-has_pass_slot-false contract |
| §178 (Wave 3 3a) | P1 audit claim "12 `TOTAL_CELLS` literal sites in production code" | 3a impl rg sweep | Real count was 19 substitutions (some lines carried two literals each); disclosed in P1.1 commit body; SD4 application |
| §178 (Wave 2 P15) | P15 audit claim "10 dead PyMCTSTree setters" | Implementer D rg sweep | Real count 12; commit `1d68d5b` lists correct enumeration; SD4 application |

### Archive reference

`reports/sprint_archive/§178_rust_engine_audit.md` (user post-cycle action — preserve full audit tree forensics for cross-cycle reference per `audit/rust-engine/wave_3/3d/archive_prep_note.md`). Memory: pending — recommend `project_178_rust_engine_audit.md` covering cycle outcome + SD6 entry + INV15/16/17 pin paths for cross-session lookup.
