# Part 1 — Architecture & Features

## 1. Network Architecture

**Files:** `hexo_rl/model/network.py`, `hexo_rl/training/trainer.py`,
`configs/model.yaml`, `configs/training.yaml`

```
Input:  (18, 19, 19) tensor
        Planes 0-15: 8 history steps × 2 players (cluster snapshots)
        Planes 16-17: metadata (moves_remaining, turn parity)

Trunk:  12 × ResidualBlock(128ch, SE reduction=4)
        Pre-activation (BN → ReLU → Conv)
        SE blocks: squeeze C→C/4→C per block (~1% FLOPs, validated in KataGo/LCZero)

Heads:
  Policy:      Conv(128→2, 1×1) → BN → ReLU → FC → log_softmax
  Value:       GlobalAvgPool + GlobalMaxPool → concat(256) → FC(256) → FC(1) → tanh
               Loss: BCE(sigmoid(v_logit), (z+1)/2)   ← logit path avoids atanh NaN
  Opp reply:   Mirror of policy, training only, weight=0.15
  Ownership:   Conv(1×1) → tanh → (19×19), weight=0.1, spatial MSE
  Threat:      Conv(1×1) → raw logit → (19×19), weight=0.1, BCE with logits
  Uncertainty: trunk → AdaptiveAvgPool → Linear → Softplus → σ² (DISABLED — see below)

Output: (log_policy, value, value_logit)  ← always 3-tuple for all inference callers
```

- `forward()` always returns the 3-tuple. BCE loss needs the raw logit; atanh(tanh(x)) was numerically unstable (NaN).
- Value loss: BCE not MSE — sharper gradients for binary outcomes.
- Global pooling value head is board-size-independent.
- Ownership head rationale: teaches the network where stones end up, giving the value head spatial grounding far from game end.
- Threat head rationale: teaches which cells form winning patterns, directly supporting quiescence reasoning.

**Policy target pruning:** Zero out entries < 2% of max visits, renormalise before CE/KL loss. Config: `policy_prune_frac: 0.02`. Applied once in Python training — Rust `get_improved_policy()` no longer prunes (double-pruning removed at §62 because first prune + renorm makes second prune non-idempotent, producing targets much sharper than intended).

**Entropy regularisation:** `L_total = L_policy + L_value + w_aux·L_aux − w_entropy·H(π)`. Weight `entropy_reg_weight: 0.01`. Expected range ~3–6 nats; < 1.0 signals collapse.

**Uncertainty head (DISABLED):** Built at §33 (`forward(uncertainty=True)` returns σ², gradient stopped before reaching value head). Head exists in `network.py` but `uncertainty_weight: 0.0` in `configs/training.yaml` gates it entirely — `use_uncertainty=False` means the head never runs in the current training path. Disabled at §59 because Gaussian NLL diverges when σ² → 1e-6 clamp floor, causing `total_loss` spikes to ~394. `uncertainty_weight: 0.0` must be explicit in config — absence causes the trainer default to silently match but is fragile on resume. Re-enable only after adding σ² regularisation (log-barrier or β-VAE-style KL).

### torch.compile — DISABLED (§32)

Arc: §3 added `reduce-overhead` → §25 re-enabled with split train/inf model instances → §30 changed to `mode="default"` (TLS crash on Python 3.14) → §32 fully disabled (27 GB Triton JIT spike blocks workers for 5+ min on first forward).

**Final state:** `torch_compile: false` in `configs/training.yaml`.
**Re-enablement criteria:** Deferred until PyTorch stabilises CUDA graph support on Python 3.14. Track upstream pytorch/pytorch issues.

The benchmark delta for torch.compile was only +3% worker throughput — not worth the instability.

---

## 2. MCTS

**Files:** `engine/src/mcts/`, `engine/src/board/`, `engine/src/game_runner.rs`,
`configs/selfplay.yaml`, `hexo_rl/selfplay/pool.py`

### Legal Move Margin — corrected to hex-ball radius 8 (§26)

Official rule: new hex ≤ 8 cells from any existing stone. Prior implementation used bbox+2 expansion (~5×5 rectangle per stone — far too small). Fixed to per-stone hex ball iteration: all (dq,dr) with `|dq|≤8, |dr|≤8, |dq+dr|≤8`. 217 cells/stone, deduplicated via FxHashSet. `LEGAL_MOVE_RADIUS = 8`. This also matches `get_clusters()` which uses distance ≤ 8 for NN windowing — same threshold, independent purposes.

This correction ~9× expanded the branching factor and is the primary driver of MCTS sim/s reduction from ~190k → ~31k. Targets recalibrated accordingly.

### action_idx widened u16 → u32 (§38)

Pre-existing silent bug: u16 cap at 65,535 caused wrong child selection with global axial coordinate encoding after radius-8 legal move expansion. Fixed throughout `mcts/mod.rs` and `mcts/node.rs`.

### Dynamic FPU (§27)

```
explored_mass = Σ prior(a) for visited children
fpu_value     = parent_q − fpu_base × √explored_mass
```

Unvisited children use `fpu_value` instead of Q=0. As more children are visited, `fpu_value` becomes more pessimistic relative to `parent_q`, shifting exploration toward refining known-good branches. Config: `mcts.fpu_reduction: 0.25` (matches KrakenBot).

**Benchmark note:** fpu_reduction=0.25 causes MCTS sim/s regression in the CPU-only benchmark because all NN values=0 → FPU makes unvisited children look worse than visited → deeper/narrower tree. This is a benchmark artifact. In real self-play with non-zero NN values, FPU improves selection quality.

### Quiescence Value Override (§28 + §30 gate)

**Game-specific theorem:** Each turn places exactly 2 stones. Therefore the opponent can block at most 2 winning cells per response. If the current player has ≥3 empty cells where placing a stone completes a 6-in-a-row, the win is mathematically forced.

**Critical distinction from the removed forced-win short-circuit:**
The earlier `FormationDetector::has_forced_win()` short-circuit (removed post-baseline) fired at MCTS **expansion** and marked positions as terminal — the NN never evaluated them, preventing the network from learning forced-win patterns.

This quiescence check is a **VALUE OVERRIDE at leaf evaluation**:
- The NN still receives the position and produces (policy, value).
- The **POLICY is used unchanged** for MCTS expansion → network learns fork patterns.
- Only the **VALUE** is overridden with the proven result.

```
current_wins >= 3  → value = +1.0
opponent_wins >= 3 → value = -1.0
current_wins == 2  → value = min(value + blend_2, 1.0)
opponent_wins == 2 → value = max(value - blend_2, -1.0)
```

Config: `mcts.quiescence_enabled: true`, `mcts.quiescence_blend_2: 0.3`

**Two-tier performance gate (§30):** `count_winning_moves()` is O(legal_moves). Gate it:
1. Ply gate (free): skip if `board.ply < 8` (P1 needs ≥5 stones = ply 8 minimum).
2. Long-run pre-check: skip if neither player has `Board::has_player_long_run(5)`.
Net overhead: 1.8% vs no quiescence in the gated benchmark.

### ZOI (Zone of Interest) Lookback (§36)

Restricts MCTS candidates to cells within hex-distance 5 of the last 16 moves. Falls back to full legal set if < 3 candidates. Reduces effective branching factor without changing legal moves.

Config: `mcts.zoi_enabled: true`, `mcts.zoi_radius: 5`, `mcts.zoi_history: 16`, `mcts.zoi_min_candidates: 3`

### Cosine-Annealed Temperature (§36)

Replaced hard step at move 30 with smooth cosine schedule:
```
temperature = temp_min + 0.5 × (1 − temp_min) × (1 + cos(π × ply / anneal_moves))
```
Eliminates policy entropy spikes at ply 30. Config: `mcts.temp_min: 0.05`, `mcts.temp_anneal_moves: 60`

### Transposition Table — clear on new_game (§59)

`MCTSTree::new_game()` was resetting the node pool but not clearing the TT. Each `TTEntry` holds a heap-allocated `Vec<f32>` (362-element policy). With 12 workers × ~67 games each × ~100 moves × ~300 positions/move × ~1.5 KB/entry, the TT accumulated tens of GB over a sustained run (observed: 28 GB RSS after 500 min).

Fix: `self.transposition_table.clear()` added to `new_game()`. TT is per-game by nature — cross-game position reuse is negligible.

### Gumbel AlphaZero (§61 + §62) — OFF by default

Implements Danihelka et al. ICLR 2022. Two components:

**Completed Q-values policy targets:**
Standard AlphaZero trains policy toward visit-count distributions. At 50 sims (fast games, 25% of training), visit counts barely differ from prior. Instead:
1. Visited children (N>0): use Q(a) = W(a)/N(a)
2. Unvisited legal actions: use v_mix (interpolates root value with policy-weighted avg of visited Q)
3. `π_improved = softmax(log_prior + σ(completedQ))` where `σ = (c_visit + max_N) × c_scale × completedQ`
4. Training loss: KL(π_improved ∥ π_model) instead of CE with visit counts

Computed in Rust (`MCTSTree::get_improved_policy`) — all data is local, no extra PyO3 crossings. Config: `completed_q_values: true`, `c_visit: 50.0`, `c_scale: 1.0`.

**Sequential Halving root search:**
1. Gumbel-Top-k: generate Gumbel(0,1) noise, select top `m = min(n, 16, |legal|)` candidates. Replaces Dirichlet noise at root.
2. Sequential Halving: allocate budget across `ceil(log2(m))` phases, halving candidates each phase by `g(a) + log_prior(a) + sigma(Q_hat(a))`.
Non-root nodes: unchanged (PUCT + dynamic FPU).

**Hardening fixes (§62):** Budget off-by-one fixed (`sims_done = sims_used` in fallback). `max_n` cached per halving phase (was O(candidates²), now O(candidates)). Double-pruning removed (see policy target pruning note above). Config defaults restored: `gumbel_mcts: false`, `fast_prob: 0.25`.

Config: `gumbel_mcts: false` (opt-in), `gumbel_m: 16`, `gumbel_explore_moves: 10`

---

## 3. Replay Buffer

**Files:** `engine/src/replay_buffer/`, `hexo_rl/training/recency_buffer.py`,
`hexo_rl/selfplay/pool.py`, `configs/training.yaml`

### Growing Buffer + Mixed Streams (§2 + §40b)

Buffer growth schedule:
```yaml
buffer_schedule:
  - {step: 0,       capacity: 100_000}
  - {step: 150_000, capacity: 250_000}
  - {step: 500_000, capacity: 500_000}
```
`ReplayBuffer.resize()` linearises ring buffer in-place via rotate_left, extends backing vecs.

Mixed pretrained + self-play: `pretrained_weight = max(0.1, 0.8 × exp(−step / 300_000))`. After §58 fix: pretrained stream is always initialised from the corpus NPZ when the file exists, regardless of `_buffer_restored`.

### Playout Cap Randomisation (§2 + §43)

- 25% of games: 50 sims, τ=1 throughout (value targets only — policy masked on zero-policy rows)
- 75% of games: 200 sims, τ=1 for first 15 compound moves then τ→0

Config: `playout_cap.fast_prob: 0.25`, `fast_sims: 50`, `standard_sims: 200`. fast_sims was tested at 30 and reverted — 50 produces meaningfully better policy signal for fast-game value targets.

### Recency-Weighted Replay (§33)

Lightweight Python-side `RecentBuffer` ring mirrors the newest ~50% of buffer capacity. Training batches: 75% recent / 25% full-buffer (augmented). Config: `recency_weight: 0.75`. Falls back to full-buffer when recent buffer is empty.

### Buffer Persistence (§46b)

Save/load added to `ReplayBuffer`: binary HEXB v1 format (magic `0x48455842`, little-endian). ~14.4 KB/entry; ~1.4 GB for 100K positions.

Two save points to prevent loss on unclean exit:
1. Inside `_run_loop()` on shutdown signal (before `break`, before `pool.stop()`).
2. Post-loop finally block (normal exit).

On resume: buffer is restored before `pool.start()`. Corpus prefill is skipped when `n_loaded >= 10_000` (threshold from §58 fix — `n_loaded > 0` was too permissive).

Config: `mixing.buffer_persist: true`, `mixing.buffer_persist_path: "checkpoints/replay_buffer.bin"`

### collect_data PyArray fix (§51)

Changed `collect_data()` return from `Vec<(Vec<f32>, Vec<f32>, f32, usize)>` to `(PyArray2<f32>, PyArray2<f32>, PyArray1<f32>, PyArray1<u64>)`. Previously each `Vec<f32>` was converted to a Python list of Python float objects via pymalloc arenas — at ~10 Hz this accumulated ~0.15 GB/min RSS. Zero-copy NumPy path eliminates this entirely.

---

## 4. Data Pipeline & Corpus

### Corpus Generation (§5)

`generate_corpus.py`: SealBot self-play, SHA-256 hash-based filenames for deduplication. Random opening injection: 3 random moves (d4) or 1 random move (d6+) before SealBot takes over. Reduced dupe rate 87%→43% at d4. SealBot time cap: 1s/move. Makefile targets: `corpus.fast` (5K games, 0.1s), `corpus.strong` (2.5K games, 0.5s).

### Scraper — white-box API (§21)

`hexo.did.science` = `WolverinDEV/infhex-tic-tac-toe` repo (confirmed). Key findings that drove changes:
- `baseTimestamp` is correct param (not `before`) — fixed
- Public game cap is exactly 500 (not 480) — updated `UNAUTHENTICATED_GAME_LIMIT`
- `/api/leaderboard` exists unauthenticated → `--top-players-only` flag added
- Per-game Elo in `DatabaseGamePlayer.elo` → `player_black_elo`/`player_white_elo` stored in game JSON
- Coordinates are direct axial (q=x, r=y) — no translation needed

Dual-pass `scrape_daily.sh`: standard 500-game pull + top-20 player profile pull. Manifest includes `elo_bands` breakdown. All scraper flags in `configs/corpus.yaml`.

### mmap Corpus Loading — active pattern (§19 + §35)

**Root cause:** `np.load()` (no mmap) + `np.concatenate()` on full corpus (~906K positions) caused ~26 GB peak RAM → system freeze.

**Pattern:**
1. `make corpus.npz` produces a 50K-position uncompressed NPZ (`np.savez`, not `savez_compressed`).
   Uncompressed is required — `savez_compressed` defeats `mmap_mode='r'`.
2. Load with `np.load(path, mmap_mode='r')` — OS pages data on demand, RAM stays near-zero.
3. `del pre_states, pre_policies, pre_outcomes` immediately after `push_game()` releases mmap views.
   Keeping views alive for the entire process lifetime was a confirmed ~720 MB leak (§46).

**Warning:** If `bootstrap_corpus.npz` is absent, `load_corpus()` fallback runs and the double-allocation risk returns. **Always run `make corpus.npz` before `make pretrain.full`.**

Config: `corpus_npz_path` in `configs/corpus.yaml`. `mixing.pretrain_max_samples: 200_000` caps corpus even if NPZ is large.

### Pretrain Checkpoint Hygiene (§34)

**Decision: always use `checkpoints/bootstrap_model.pt` as the RL entry point.**

| File | step | scheduler last_epoch | Type | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pretrain/pretrain_00000000.pt` | 0 | ~53K (exhausted) | full checkpoint | **Do not use for RL** — LR ≈ eta_min (1e-5) at start, learns almost nothing. |
| `pretrain/pretrain_00053130.pt` | 53130 | 53130 | full checkpoint | Human-only pretrain reference only. |
| `checkpoints/bootstrap_model.pt` | N/A | N/A | **weights-only** | **Use this for RL.** Fresh optimizer + scheduler from config. |

`bootstrap_model.pt` is weights-only. `Trainer.load_checkpoint` detects this, sets `trainer.step = 0`, constructs fresh scheduler. `make train` already uses this via `CHECKPOINT_BOOTSTRAP` in Makefile.

### Validation Game Count (§20)

Pretrain validation: 100 greedy games vs RandomBot (was 5 — statistically meaningless). 95% CI width at p=0.5 is ±~10% at n=100.

### Sequential Action Space (§6) — confirmed correct

- 2 MCTS plies per 2-stone compound turn
- Q-value sign flips **only at turn boundaries**, not at intermediate ply
- Dirichlet noise skipped at intermediate ply
- Plane 16 encodes `moves_remaining == 2`

---

## 5. Evaluation Pipeline

**Files:** `hexo_rl/eval/`, `configs/eval.yaml`, `configs/training.yaml`

- Bradley-Terry MLE (not incremental Elo). scipy L-BFGS-B with L2 regularisation 1e-6 to prevent divergence on perfect records.
- SQLite results store (WAL mode). Full BT recomputation from all historical pairwise data after each eval round.
- Gating rule: new checkpoint promoted if win_rate ≥ 0.55 over 50 games vs best checkpoint.
- Opponents: previous best, SealBot (fixed external Elo reference), RandomBot (sanity floor).
- Evaluation in a separate thread; model cloned (fresh HexTacToeNet) to avoid sharing compiled training model.

**eval_interval arc:** §52 changed 500→2000 (eval was blocking self-play). §60 changed 2000→5000 (at step 2000, SealBot winrate was 0/22; eval took 130 min = 55% of wall-clock). **Final: `eval_interval: 5000`** in `configs/training.yaml`, `best_checkpoint n_games: 50` in `configs/eval.yaml`. At ~490 steps/hr, one eval every ~10 hours = ~9% overhead.

---

## 6. Training Loop & Stability

### FP16 NaN Guard (§47) — active fix, must not revert

**Root cause chain:**
1. `compute_aux_loss`: policy_prune_frac zeros low-visit entries. Zero target × `log_softmax(-inf)` = `0×-inf = NaN` under FP16.
2. Entropy bonus: `log_policy.exp()` underflows to 0.0 for near-zero probs under FP16, then multiplies `-inf` log entry.
3. BatchNorm contamination: BN running stats updated **during forward pass, before GradScaler**. One poisoned forward NaN's all subsequent passes even if optimizer step is skipped.

**Why GradScaler alone is insufficient:** GradScaler checks `torch.isinf()` on gradients, not `torch.isnan()`. `0×-inf` NaN passes the inf check entirely.

**Fixes:**
- `compute_aux_loss`: clamp log-probs to `min=-100.0` before multiplication.
- Entropy (two sites in trainer.py): replace `-(p * log_p).sum()` with `torch.special.entr(p_fp32).sum()` (defines `0·log(0)≡0`, promotes to FP32 first).
- NaN guard: after `compute_total_loss()`, detect non-finite loss, reset poisoned BN modules, call `scaler.update()`, return early.

### Draw Penalty (§24 → §40)

Initial (§24): `draw_reward: -0.1` (KrakenBot practice for minority-outcome draws). Changed at §40 to `draw_reward: -0.5`.

**Why -0.5:** First overnight run produced 56.6% draws. At 56% frequency, expected draw target = `0.56 × -0.1 = -0.056` — too weak to break the draw-seeking equilibrium. At -0.5 the expected target = -0.280, providing a clear gradient. Once draws become rare, the penalty rarely fires and value distribution naturally re-centres on ±1.0.

### Resume Bugs Fixed (§58) — all three were confirmed in JSONL

**Bug 1 — pretrained stream not initialised on resume:** `if _buffer_restored: ... elif pretrained_path:` structure prevented corpus loading whenever any buffer was restored. Fixed: decoupled the conditions. `pretrained_buffer` always initialised from NPZ when file exists; `_buffer_restored` only controls the `corpus_prefill_skipped` log message.

**Bug 2 — corpus prefill skip threshold too low:** `_buffer_restored = (n_loaded > 0)` meant 1,770 positions skipped the corpus load. Fixed: `_buffer_restored = (n_loaded >= 10_000)`. Below threshold: `corpus_prefill_running` event logged with `reason="buffer_too_small"`.

**Bug 3 — hidden loss terms invisible in JSONL:** `log.info("train_step")` included `total_loss` but omitted `uncertainty_loss`, `ownership_loss`, `threat_loss`. These ARE in `total_loss` (weights 0.05, 0.1, 0.1) and caused apparent spikes (~390+) when uncertainty head initialised randomly on resume. Fixed: all four loss terms individually logged. Residual delta = entropy regularisation (already logged as `policy_entropy`).

### Memory Fixes

- **glibc malloc arenas (§53):** `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` prepended to all training Makefile targets. Without this, glibc creates one 64 MB arena per thread (up to 128 on 16-thread system); arenas never returned to OS → ~+2 GB/hr RSS growth. GPU allocation is unaffected (CUDA allocator).
- **RSS leaks (§46):** (1) `del pre_states, pre_policies, pre_outcomes` after push_game. (2) SocketIO `_safe_emit()` gated on connected SIDs. (3) Pre-allocated batch arrays (`np.copyto` in-place, not `np.concatenate`).
- **Buffer warmup edge case (§50):** `np.copyto` path falls back to `np.concatenate` when buffer underfull (warm-up period < batch_size positions). Flips to in-place permanently after warmup ends.

### Config Growth Reductions (§40b)

Applied during draw-collapse fix session: `buffer_schedule` reduced (100K/250K/500K, was 250K/500K/1M), `standard_sims: 400→200`, `decay_steps: 1_000_000→300_000`.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Dashboard

**Files:** `hexo_rl/monitoring/`, `configs/monitoring.yaml`

### Architecture

Event-driven fan-out: `emit_event(payload)` in `events.py` dispatches to registered renderers. Never raises; renderer failures caught and logged. Zero import side effects.

Renderers registered at startup in `train.py`:
- `TerminalDashboard` — Rich Live 4Hz render
- `WebDashboard` — Flask+SocketIO at `:5001`

Events: `run_start`, `training_step`, `iteration_complete`, `eval_complete`, `game_complete`, `system_stats`, `run_end`.

### Dashboard Enrichment (§63 + §64 + §65)

**`training_step` event additions:**
- `policy_target_entropy`: mean entropy of post-pruning MCTS policy target over batch. Computed only on non-zero-policy rows. Replaces the old `policy_excess` label (§65 fix: policy_excess = KL − H(target) after §61 switched to KL loss — had no guaranteed sign). Renamed to `policy_KL` displaying `loss_policy` directly.

**`iteration_complete` event additions:**
- `mcts_mean_depth`: mean leaf depth per sim across all moves. Accumulated in `select_leaves()` outer loop (not inside `select_one_leaf` traversal) — one count per sim.
- `mcts_root_concentration`: mean of (max_child_visits / root_total_visits) at root per move.

Depths are accumulated as ×1e6 fixed-point in AtomicU64 (first commit had truncation bug using u64 directly — self-corrected within same session before any training ran on it).

**Expected values:** At step ~3,800 with near-uniform priors and 25% fast games, mcts_mean_depth = 2–4 is physically correct. Expect ≥ 5.0 by step 50–70K (decay_steps=300K slows the transition — estimate adjusted accordingly).

**Ring buffer sizes bumped:** `training_step_history: 2000` (was 500), `game_history: 500` (was 200). Values served via `/api/monitoring-config` so SPA doesn't need hardcoding.

### Operational Fixes

- **SocketIO bounded queue (§55):** `put_nowait()` from training thread into `queue.Queue(maxsize=200)`; daemon drain thread does actual `socketio.emit()`. Training loop never blocks. Config: `monitoring.emit_queue_maxsize: 200`.
- **Structlog JSONL sink (§56):** Log file `logs/train_{run_id}.jsonl`. Handle closed in `finally` block **after** all session-end logging (earlier ordering caused `I/O operation on closed file` crash on Ctrl+C).
- **RSS tracking (§45):** `psutil.Process().memory_info().rss` sampled on every GPUMonitor poll cycle, included in `system_stats` as `rss_gb`.
- **grad_norm to structured log (§54):** Unconditional `log.info("train_step", ...)` in `_train_on_batch()` — visible in JSONL even without dashboard.

## 8. Game Viewer

**Files:** `engine/src/board/threats.rs`, `hexo_rl/viewer/engine.py`,
`hexo_rl/monitoring/web_dashboard.py`, `hexo_rl/monitoring/static/viewer.html`,
`configs/monitoring.yaml`

- Sliding-window threat detection on 3 hex axes: empty cells within 6-cell windows where one player has N≥3 stones. Levels: 5=critical (≥5), 4=forced (4), 3=warning (3). Threat cells never overlap with occupied cells (tested). Viewer-only — never called from MCTS or training path.
- Game records written to `runs/<run_id>/games/<game_id>.json` on arrival. In-memory index capped at 50 entries (`monitoring.viewer_max_memory_games`). Disk rotated to `monitoring.viewer_max_disk_games: 1000` oldest-first.
- Viewer URL: `http://localhost:5001/viewer` (during training).
- Features: hex board canvas (pointy-top), threat overlay, MCTS visit heatmap (toggle), value sparkline, scrubber, play-against-model mode.

## 9. Gumbel MCTS Activation & Training Restart (§66)

**Date:** 2026-04-07
**Files:** `configs/selfplay.yaml`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/reviews/2026-04_architecture_review.md`

- **`gumbel_mcts: true` on desktop is intentional.** The desktop (Ryzen 7 3700x + RTX 3070) config has `gumbel_mcts: true` in `configs/selfplay.yaml` for the Phase 4.0 sustained run. Laptop and cloud configs remain `false` until benchmarked on those hosts. CLAUDE.md updated to document this per-host override rather than stating a single default.
- **`completed_q_values` KL loss was silently disabled.** Architecture review (C1) found that `trainer.py:305` performs a nested-dict lookup (`self.config.get("selfplay", {}).get("completed_q_values", False)`) into the flattened `combined_config` dict, which always returns `False`. The intended KL policy loss was never active — all prior self-play training used CE loss instead. Fix is tracked as a separate commit (one-line change to flat key lookup).
- **Phase 4.0 sustained run will restart from Phase 3C pretrained weights** after the C1 fix lands. The prior run (~18,750 steps) trained under CE loss instead of the intended KL loss, so those checkpoints are not valid for the Phase 4.0 exit criterion. Restart is intentional, not a regression.
- **Benchmark baseline is pre-Gumbel.** The MCTS 55,478 sim/s figure was measured with `gumbel_mcts: false`. Gumbel Sequential Halving adds overhead at the root; re-bench is pending after the C1 fix and restart.

# Part 2 — Operational Record

## Current Authoritative Benchmark Baseline

**2026-04-06, Ryzen 7 8845HS + RTX 4060 Laptop, bench.full n=5, 3s warm-up, LTO+native**

| Metric | Baseline (median) | Target | IQR |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCTS (CPU only, 800 sims/move × 62 iters) | 55,478 sim/s | ≥ 26,000 sim/s | ±400 |
| NN inference batch=64 | 9,810 pos/s | ≥ 8,500 pos/s | ±1 |
| NN latency batch=1 | 1.59 ms | ≤ 3.5 ms | ±0.05 ms |
| Replay buffer push | 762,130 pos/sec | ≥ 630,000 pos/sec | ±114,320 |
| Buffer sample raw (batch=256) | 1,037 µs/batch | ≤ 1,500 µs | ±34 µs |
| Buffer sample augmented (batch=256) | 940 µs/batch | ≤ 1,400 µs | ±62 µs |
| GPU utilisation | 100.0% | ≥ 85% | ±0 |
| VRAM usage (process) | 0.05 GB / 8.0 GB | ≤ 6.4 GB | ±0 |
| Worker throughput | 659,983 pos/hr | ≥ 625,000 pos/hr | ±56,835 |
| Batch fill % | 100.0% | ≥ 80% | ±0 |

All 10 targets PASS. Methodology: median n=5, 3s warm-up, realistic MCTS workload (800 sims/move × 62 iterations with tree reset), CPU unpinned (n=5 median provides sufficient variance control).

## Benchmark Evolution

| Date | What was wrong | What changed | Impact on targets |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-01 | MCTS workload was burst (50K sims in one tree) — exceeded L2 cache, inflated by boost clocks | Changed to 800 sims/move × 62 iter with tree reset; n=5 median | MCTS target dropped from 160K to realistic steady-state |
| 2026-04-03 | benchmark.py read `config.get('res_blocks')` (top-level) instead of `config['model']['res_blocks']` — measured wrong (smaller) model; VRAM used pynvml global not process-specific; single pool per measurement window included cold-start | Fixed model config path; switched to `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`; keep one warm pool across all measurement windows | Worker throughput baseline corrected 1.18M→735K; NN latency 1.52ms→2.90ms; targets recalibrated |
| 2026-04-04 | Legal move radius corrected bbox+2→radius 8 (~9× branching factor expansion) + FPU behavioral tree shape change | Both are correct behaviour changes, not regressions | MCTS target rebaselined to ≥26K (85% of new ~31K median) |

## Regressions & Reversions

| Feature | When Added | Reverted | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| SealBot mixed opponent in self-play | §17 (2026-04-02) | Immediately (`c9f39de`) | Python daemon threads caused 3.3× GIL contention regression (1.52M→464K pos/hr). **Do not re-litigate** — GIL regression was an implementation issue, not a conceptual flaw. Re-add post-Phase 4.5 baseline using subprocess-based wrapper to avoid GIL. |
| Forced-win short-circuit (`FormationDetector::has_forced_win()`) | Pre-sprint | Removed (2026-04-02) | MCTS bypassed NN for near-win positions → network never learned to evaluate them. Removing adds ~30% more NN calls/game (batch fill 99.4%→99.82%) but training quality requires it. |
| draw_reward: -0.1 | §24 | Raised to -0.5 at §40 | Not a revert — a correction. -0.1 assumed draws were minority; at 56% draw rate the signal was too weak to break equilibrium. |
| torch.compile | §3 | Disabled §32 | Python 3.14 CUDA graph incompatibility cascade (TLS crash → Triton spike). |
| uncertainty_weight: 0.05 | §33 | Set to 0.0 at §59 | Gaussian NLL diverges when σ²→clamp floor; total_loss spiked to ~394. |

## Key Resolved Bugs

| § | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| §26 | Legal move radius bbox+2 instead of radius 8 | ~9× too-small branching factor; invalid MCTS search | Per-stone hex ball iteration |
| §38 | `action_idx` u16 overflow (cap 65,535) | Silent MCTS tree corruption with global axial coords | Widen to u32 |
| §47 | FP16 0×-inf NaN cascade | NaN total_loss, BN poisoning, training halt | Log-clamp aux CE; `torch.special.entr()` for entropy; BN reset guard |
| §58 | Three resume bugs | Pretrained stream silently disabled on resume; hidden loss spikes | Decouple buffer-restore from corpus-load; threshold 10K; log all loss terms |
| §59 | TT memory leak (`new_game()` did not clear TT) | 28 GB RSS after 500 min | `self.transposition_table.clear()` in `new_game()` |

### §66 — C1 bug impact assessment (amendment)

The C1 bug affected only the reported loss scalar, not training dynamics. CE and KL against fixed targets share gradients, so the checkpoint is valid and the Phase 4.0 run continues uninterrupted. The fix restores correct loss reporting and interpretability for the remainder of the run.
